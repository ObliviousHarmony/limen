Enable them by adding `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` to your [settings.json](/en/settings) or environment. Agent teams have [known limitations](#limitations) around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behavior.\n</Warning>\n\nAgent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances working together. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results. Teammates work independently, each in its own context window, and communicate directly with each other.\n\nUnlike [subagents](/en/sub-agents), which run within a single session and can only report back to the main agent, you can also interact with individual teammates directly without going through the lead.\n\nThis page covers:\n\n* [When to use agent teams](#when-to-use-agent-teams), including best use cases and how they compare with subagents\n* [Starting a team](#start-your-first-agent-team)\n* [Controlling teammates](#control-your-agent-team), including display modes, task assignment, and delegation\n* [Best practices for parallel work](#best-practices)\n\n## When to use agent teams\n\nAgent teams are most effective for tasks where parallel exploration adds real value. See [use case examples](#use-case-examples) for full scenarios. The strongest use cases are:\n\n* **Research and review**: multiple teammates can investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then share and challenge each other's findings\n* **New modules or features**: teammates can each own a separate piece without stepping on each other\n* **Debugging with competing hypotheses**: teammates test different theories in parallel and converge on the answer faster\n* **Cross-layer coordination**: changes that span frontend, backend, and tests, each owned by a different teammate\n\nAgent teams add coordination overhead and use significantly more tokens than a single session. They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, same-file edits, or work with many dependencies, a single session or [subagents](/en/sub-agents) are more effective.\n\n### Compare with subagents\n\nBoth agent teams and [subagents](/en/sub-agents) let you parallelize work, but they operate differently. Choose based on whether your workers need to communicate with each other:\n\n<Frame caption=\"Subagents only report results back to the main agent and never talk to each other.

Use agent teams when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate on their own.\n\n## Enable agent teams\n\nAgent teams are disabled by default. Enable them by setting the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` environment variable to `1`, either in your shell environment or through [settings.json](/en/settings):\n\n```json settings.json theme={null}\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Start your first agent team\n\nAfter enabling agent teams, tell Claude to create an agent team and describe the task and the team structure you want in natural language. Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work based on your prompt.\n\nThis example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other:\n\n```\nI'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across\ntheir codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one\nteammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.\n```\n\nFrom there, Claude creates a team with a [shared task list](/en/interactive-mode#task-list), spawns teammates for each perspective, has them explore the problem, synthesizes findings, and attempts to [clean up the team](#clean-up-the-team) when finished.\n\nThe lead's terminal lists all teammates and what they're working on. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and message them directly.\n\nIf you want each teammate in its own split pane, see [Choose a display mode](#choose-a-display-mode).\n\n## Control your agent team\n\nTell the lead what you want in natural language. It handles team coordination, task assignment, and delegation based on your instructions.\n\n### Choose a display mode\n\nAgent teams support two display modes:\n\n* **In-process**: all teammates run inside your main terminal. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and type to message them directly. Works in any terminal, no extra setup required.\n* **Split panes**: each teammate gets its own pane. You can see everyone's output at once and click into a pane to interact directly. Requires tmux, or iTerm2.\n\n<Note>\n  `tmux` has known limitations on certain operating systems and traditionally works best on macOS. Using `tmux -CC` in iTerm2 is the suggested entrypoint into `tmux`.\n</Note>\n\nThe default is `\"auto\"`, which uses split panes if you're already running inside a tmux session, and in-process otherwise. The `\"tmux\"` setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects whether to use tmux or iTerm2 based on your terminal. To override, set `teammateMode` in your [settings.json](/en/settings):\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"teammateMode\": \"in-process\"\n}\n```\n\nTo force in-process mode for a single session, pass it as a flag:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --teammate-mode in-process\n```\n\nSplit-pane mode requires either [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or iTerm2 with the [`it2` CLI](https://github.com/mkusaka/it2). To install manually:\n\n* **tmux**: install through your system's package manager. See the [tmux wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) for platform-specific instructions.\n* **iTerm2**: install the [`it2` CLI](https://github.com/mkusaka/it2), then enable the Python API in **iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API**.\n\n### Specify teammates and models\n\nClaude decides the number of teammates to spawn based on your task, or you can specify exactly what you want:\n\n```\nCreate a team with 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.\nUse Sonnet for each teammate.\n```\n\n### Require plan approval for teammates\n\nFor complex or risky tasks, you can require teammates to plan before implementing. The teammate works in read-only plan mode until the lead approves their approach:\n\n```\nSpawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.\nRequire plan approval before they make any changes.\n```\n\nWhen a teammate finishes planning, it sends a plan approval request to the lead. The lead reviews the plan and either approves it or rejects it with feedback. If rejected, the teammate stays in plan mode, revises based on the feedback, and resubmits. Once approved, the teammate exits plan mode and begins implementation.\n\nThe lead makes approval decisions autonomously. To influence the lead's judgment, give it criteria in your prompt, such as \"only approve plans that include test coverage\" or \"reject plans that modify the database schema.\"\n\n### Use delegate mode\n\nWithout delegate mode, the lead sometimes starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. Delegate mode prevents this by restricting the lead to coordination-only tools: spawning, messaging, shutting down teammates, and managing tasks.\n\nThis is useful when you want the lead to focus entirely on orchestration, such as breaking down work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results, without touching code directly.\n\nTo enable it, start a team first, then press Shift+Tab to cycle into delegate mode.\n\n### Talk to teammates directly\n\nEach teammate is a full, independent Claude Code session. You can message any teammate directly to give additional instructions, ask follow-up questions, or redirect their approach.\n\n* **In-process mode**: use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate, then type to send them a message. Press Enter to view a teammate's session, then Escape to interrupt their current turn. Press Ctrl+T to toggle the task list.\n* **Split-pane mode**: click into a teammate's pane to interact with their session directly. Each teammate has a full view of their own terminal.\n\n### Assign and claim tasks\n\nThe shared task list coordinates work across the team. The lead creates tasks and teammates work through them. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, and completed. Tasks can also depend on other tasks: a pending task with unresolved dependencies cannot be claimed until those dependencies are completed.\n\nThe lead can assign tasks explicitly, or teammates can self-claim:\n\n* **Lead assigns**: tell the lead which task to give to which teammate\n* **Self-claim**: after finishing a task, a teammate picks up the next unassigned, unblocked task on its own\n\nTask claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple teammates try to claim the same task simultaneously.\n\n### Shut down teammates\n\nTo gracefully end a teammate's session:\n\n```\nAsk the researcher teammate to shut down\n```\n\nThe lead sends a shutdown request. The teammate can approve, exiting gracefully, or reject with an explanation.\n\n### Clean up the team\n\nWhen you're done, ask the lead to clean up:\n\n```\nClean up the team\n```\n\nThis removes the shared team resources. When the lead runs cleanup, it checks for active teammates and fails if any are still running, so shut them down first.\n\n<Warning>\n  Always use the lead to clean up. Teammates should not run cleanup because their team context may not resolve correctly, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state.\n</Warning>\n\n### Enforce quality gates with hooks\n\nUse [hooks](/en/hooks) to enforce rules when teammates finish work or tasks complete:\n\n* [`TeammateIdle`](/en/hooks#teammateidle): runs when a teammate is about to go idle. Exit with code 2 to send feedback and keep the teammate working.\n* [`TaskCompleted`](/en/hooks#taskcompleted): runs when a task is being marked complete. Exit with code 2 to prevent completion and send feedback.\n\n## How agent teams work\n\nThis section covers the architecture and mechanics behind agent teams. If you want to start using them, see [Control your agent team](#control-your-agent-team) above.\n\n### How Claude starts agent teams\n\nThere are two ways agent teams get started:\n\n* **You request a team**: give Claude a task that benefits from parallel work and explicitly ask for an agent team. Claude creates one based on your instructions.\n* **Claude proposes a team**: if Claude determines your task would benefit from parallel work, it may suggest creating a team. You confirm before it proceeds.\n\nIn both cases, you stay in control. Claude won't create a team without your approval.\n\n### Architecture\n\nAn agent team consists of:\n\n| Component     | Role                                                                                       |\n| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Team lead** | The main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work |\n| **Teammates** | Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks                            |\n| **Task list** | Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete                                |\n| **Mailbox**   | Messaging system for communication between agents                                          |\n\nSee [Choose a display mode](#choose-a-display-mode) for display configuration options. Teammate messages arrive at the lead automatically.\n\nThe system manages task dependencies automatically. When a teammate completes a task that other tasks depend on, blocked tasks unblock without manual intervention.\n\nTeams and tasks are stored locally:\n\n* **Team config**: `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`\n* **Task list**: `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`\n\nThe team config contains a `members` array with each teammate's name, agent ID, and agent type. Teammates can read this file to discover other team members.\n\n### Permissions\n\nTeammates start with the lead's permission settings. If the lead runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, all teammates do too. After spawning, you can change individual teammate modes, but you can't set per-teammate modes at spawn time.\n\n### Context and communication\n\nEach teammate has its own context window. When spawned, a teammate loads the same project context as a regular session: CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills. It also receives the spawn prompt from the lead. The lead's conversation history does not carry over.\n\n**How teammates share information:**\n\n* **Automatic message delivery**: when teammates send messages, they're delivered automatically to recipients. The lead doesn't need to poll for updates.\n* **Idle notifications**: when a teammate finishes and stops, they automatically notify the lead.\n* **Shared task list**: all agents can see task status and claim available work.\n\n**Teammate messaging:**\n\n* **message**: send a message to one specific teammate\n* **broadcast**: send to all teammates simultaneously. Use sparingly, as costs scale with team size.\n\n### Token usage\n\nAgent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Each teammate has its own context window, and token usage scales with the number of active teammates. For research, review, and new feature work, the extra tokens are usually worthwhile. For routine tasks, a single session is more cost-effective. See [agent team token costs](/en/costs#agent-team-token-costs) for usage guidance.\n\n## Use case examples\n\nThese examples show how agent teams handle tasks where parallel exploration adds value.\n\n### Run a parallel code review\n\nA single reviewer tends to gravitate toward one type of issue at a time. Splitting review criteria into independent domains means security, performance, and test coverage all get thorough attention simultaneously. The prompt assigns each teammate a distinct lens so they don't overlap:\n\n```\nCreate an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:\n- One focused on security implications\n- One checking performance impact\n- One validating test coverage\nHave them each review and report findings.\n```\n\nEach reviewer works from the same PR but applies a different filter. The lead synthesizes findings across all three after they finish.\n\n### Investigate with competing hypotheses\n\nWhen the root cause is unclear, a single agent tends to find one plausible explanation and stop looking. The prompt fights this by making teammates explicitly adversarial: each one's job is not only to investigate its own theory but to challenge the others'.\n\n```\nUsers report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.\nSpawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to\neach other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific\ndebate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.\n```\n\nThe debate structure is the key mechanism here. Sequential investigation suffers from anchoring: once one theory is explored, subsequent investigation is biased toward it.\n\nWith multiple independent investigators actively trying to disprove each other, the theory that survives is much more likely to be the actual root cause.\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Give teammates enough context\n\nTeammates load project context automatically, including CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills, but they don't inherit the lead's conversation history. See [Context and communication](#context-and-communication) for details. Include task-specific details in the spawn prompt:\n\n```\nSpawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: \"Review the authentication module\nat src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session\nmanagement, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in\nhttpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings.\"\n```\n\n### Size tasks appropriately\n\n* **Too small**: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit\n* **Too large**: teammates work too long without check-ins, increasing risk of wasted effort\n* **Just right**: self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable, such as a function, a test file, or a review\n\n<Tip>\n  The lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them to teammates automatically. If it isn't creating enough tasks, ask it to split the work into smaller pieces. Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.\n</Tip>\n\n### Wait for teammates to finish\n\nSometimes the lead starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. If you notice this:\n\n```\nWait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding\n```\n\n### Start with research and review\n\nIf you're new to agent teams, start with tasks that have clear boundaries and don't require writing code: reviewing a PR, researching a library, or investigating a bug. These tasks show the value of parallel exploration without the coordination challenges that come with parallel implementation.\n\n### Avoid file conflicts\n\nTwo teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Break the work so each teammate owns a different set of files.\n\n### Monitor and steer\n\nCheck in on teammates' progress, redirect approaches that aren't working, and synthesize findings as they come in. Letting a team run unattended for too long increases the risk of wasted effort.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Teammates not appearing\n\nIf teammates aren't appearing after you ask Claude to create a team:\n\n* In in-process mode, teammates may already be running but not visible. Press Shift+Down to cycle through active teammates.\n* Check that the task you gave Claude was complex enough to warrant a team. Claude decides whether to spawn teammates based on the task.\n* If you explicitly requested split panes, ensure tmux is installed and available in your PATH:\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  which tmux\n  ```\n* For iTerm2, verify the `it2` CLI is installed and the Python API is enabled in iTerm2 preferences.\n\n### Too many permission prompts\n\nTeammate permission requests bubble up to the lead, which can create friction. Pre-approve common operations in your [permission settings](/en/permissions) before spawning teammates to reduce interruptions.\n\n### Teammates stopping on errors\n\nTeammates may stop after encountering errors instead of recovering. Check their output using Shift+Up/Down in in-process mode or by clicking the pane in split mode, then either:\n\n* Give them additional instructions directly\n* Spawn a replacement teammate to continue the work\n\n### Lead shuts down before work is done\n\nThe lead may decide the team is finished before all tasks are actually complete. If this happens, tell it to keep going. You can also tell the lead to wait for teammates to finish before proceeding if it starts doing work instead of delegating.\n\n### Orphaned tmux sessions\n\nIf a tmux session persists after the team ends, it may not have been fully cleaned up. List sessions and kill the one created by the team:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ntmux ls\ntmux kill-session -t <session-name>\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nAgent teams are experimental. Current limitations to be aware of:\n\n* **No session resumption with in-process teammates**: `/resume` and `/rewind` do not restore in-process teammates. After resuming a session, the lead may attempt to message teammates that no longer exist. If this happens, tell the lead to spawn new teammates.\n* **Task status can lag**: teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks as completed, which blocks dependent tasks. If a task appears stuck, check whether the work is actually done and update the task status manually or tell the lead to nudge the teammate.\n* **Shutdown can be slow**: teammates finish their current request or tool call before shutting down, which can take time.\n* **One team per session**: a lead can only manage one team at a time. Clean up the current team before starting a new one.\n* **No nested teams**: teammates cannot spawn their own teams or teammates. Only the lead can manage the team.\n* **Lead is fixed**: the session that creates the team is the lead for its lifetime. You can't promote a teammate to lead or transfer leadership.\n* **Permissions set at spawn**: all teammates start with the lead's permission mode. You can change individual teammate modes after spawning, but you can't set per-teammate modes at spawn time.\n* **Split panes require tmux or iTerm2**: the default in-process mode works in any terminal.

While it excels at coding, it can help with anything you can do from the command line: writing docs, running builds, searching files, researching topics, and more.\n\nThis guide covers the core architecture, built-in capabilities, and [tips for working effectively](#work-effectively-with-claude-code). For step-by-step walkthroughs, see [Common workflows](/en/common-workflows). For extensibility features like skills, MCP, and hooks, see [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview).\n\n## The agentic loop\n\nWhen you give Claude a task, it works through three phases: **gather context**, **take action**, and **verify results**. These phases blend together. Claude uses tools throughout, whether searching files to understand your code, editing to make changes, or running tests to check its work.\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/agentic-loop.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=e30acfc80d6ff01ec877dd19c7af58b2\" alt=\"The agentic loop: Your prompt leads to Claude gathering context, taking action, verifying results, and repeating until task complete.

A question about your codebase might only need context gathering. A bug fix cycles through all three phases repeatedly. A refactor might involve extensive verification. Claude decides what each step requires based on what it learned from the previous step, chaining dozens of actions together and course-correcting along the way.\n\nYou're part of this loop too. You can interrupt at any point to steer Claude in a different direction, provide additional context, or ask it to try a different approach. Claude works autonomously but stays responsive to your input.\n\nThe agentic loop is powered by two components: [models](#models) that reason and [tools](#tools) that act. Claude Code serves as the **agentic harness** around Claude: it provides the tools, context management, and execution environment that turn a language model into a capable coding agent.\n\n### Models\n\nClaude Code uses Claude models to understand your code and reason about tasks. Claude can read code in any language, understand how components connect, and figure out what needs to change to accomplish your goal. For complex tasks, it breaks work into steps, executes them, and adjusts based on what it learns.\n\n[Multiple models](/en/model-config) are available with different tradeoffs. Sonnet handles most coding tasks well. Opus provides stronger reasoning for complex architectural decisions. Switch with `/model` during a session or start with `claude --model <name>`.\n\nWhen this guide says \"Claude chooses\" or \"Claude decides,\" it's the model doing the reasoning.\n\n### Tools\n\nTools are what make Claude Code agentic. Without tools, Claude can only respond with text. With tools, Claude can act: read your code, edit files, run commands, search the web, and interact with external services. Each tool use returns information that feeds back into the loop, informing Claude's next decision.\n\nThe built-in tools generally fall into four categories, each representing a different kind of agency.\n\n| Category              | What Claude can do                                                                                                                                            |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **File operations**   | Read files, edit code, create new files, rename and reorganize                                                                                                |\n| **Search**            | Find files by pattern, search content with regex, explore codebases                                                                                           |\n| **Execution**         | Run shell commands, start servers, run tests, use git                                                                                                         |\n| **Web**               | Search the web, fetch documentation, look up error messages                                                                                                   |\n| **Code intelligence** | See type errors and warnings after edits, jump to definitions, find references (requires [code intelligence plugins](/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence)) |\n\nThese are the primary capabilities. Claude also has tools for spawning subagents, asking you questions, and other orchestration tasks. See [Tools available to Claude](/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) for the complete list.\n\nClaude chooses which tools to use based on your prompt and what it learns along the way. When you say \"fix the failing tests,\" Claude might:\n\n1. Run the test suite to see what's failing\n2. Read the error output\n3. Search for the relevant source files\n4. Read those files to understand the code\n5. Edit the files to fix the issue\n6. Run the tests again to verify\n\nEach tool use gives Claude new information that informs the next step. This is the agentic loop in action.\n\n**Extending the base capabilities:** The built-in tools are the foundation. You can extend what Claude knows with [skills](/en/skills), connect to external services with [MCP](/en/mcp), automate workflows with [hooks](/en/hooks), and offload tasks to [subagents](/en/sub-agents). These extensions form a layer on top of the core agentic loop. See [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview) for guidance on choosing the right extension for your needs.\n\n## What Claude can access\n\nThis guide focuses on the terminal. Claude Code also runs in [VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other environments](/en/ide-integrations).\n\nWhen you run `claude` in a directory, Claude Code gains access to:\n\n* **Your project.** Files in your directory and subdirectories, plus files elsewhere with your permission.\n* **Your terminal.** Any command you could run: build tools, git, package managers, system utilities, scripts. If you can do it from the command line, Claude can too.\n* **Your git state.** Current branch, uncommitted changes, and recent commit history.\n* **Your [CLAUDE.md](/en/memory).** A markdown file where you store project-specific instructions, conventions, and context that Claude should know every session.\n* **Extensions you configure.** [MCP servers](/en/mcp) for external services, [skills](/en/skills) for workflows, [subagents](/en/sub-agents) for delegated work, and [Claude in Chrome](/en/chrome) for browser interaction.\n\nBecause Claude sees your whole project, it can work across it. When you ask Claude to \"fix the authentication bug,\" it searches for relevant files, reads multiple files to understand context, makes coordinated edits across them, runs tests to verify the fix, and commits the changes if you ask. This is different from inline code assistants that only see the current file.\n\n## Work with sessions\n\nClaude Code saves your conversation locally as you work. Each message, tool use, and result is stored, which enables [rewinding](#undo-changes-with-checkpoints), [resuming, and forking](#resume-or-fork-sessions) sessions. Before Claude makes code changes, it also snapshots the affected files so you can revert if needed.\n\n**Sessions are independent.** Each new session starts with a fresh context window, without the conversation history from previous sessions. Claude can persist learnings across sessions using [auto memory](/en/memory#auto-memory), and you can add your own persistent instructions in [CLAUDE.md](/en/memory).\n\n### Work across branches\n\nEach Claude Code conversation is a session tied to your current directory. When you resume, you only see sessions from that directory.\n\nClaude sees your current branch's files. When you switch branches, Claude sees the new branch's files, but your conversation history stays the same. Claude remembers what you discussed even after switching.\n\nSince sessions are tied to directories, you can run parallel Claude sessions by using [git worktrees](/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees), which create separate directories for individual branches.\n\n### Resume or fork sessions\n\nWhen you resume a session with `claude --continue` or `claude --resume`, you pick up where you left off using the same session ID. New messages append to the existing conversation. Your full conversation history is restored, but session-scoped permissions are not. You'll need to re-approve those.\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=f671b603cc856119c95475b9084ebfef\" alt=\"Session continuity: resume continues the same session, fork creates a new branch with a new ID.\" data-og-width=\"560\" width=\"560\" data-og-height=\"280\" height=\"280\" data-path=\"images/session-continuity.svg\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=bddf1f33d419a27d7427acdf06058804 280w, https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=417478eb9b86003b8eebaac058a8618a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=1d89d26e2c0487f067d187c3fa5f7170 840w, https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=8ea739a1f7860e4edbbcf74d444e37b2 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=9cb5095d6a8920f04c3b78d31a69c809 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/ELkJZG54dIaeldDC/images/session-continuity.svg?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=ELkJZG54dIaeldDC&q=85&s=d67e1744e4878813d20c6c3f39d9459d 2500w\" />\n\nTo branch off and try a different approach without affecting the original session, use the `--fork-session` flag:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --continue --fork-session\n```\n\nThis creates a new session ID while preserving the conversation history up to that point. The original session remains unchanged. Like resume, forked sessions don't inherit session-scoped permissions.\n\n**Same session in multiple terminals**: If you resume the same session in multiple terminals, both terminals write to the same session file. Messages from both get interleaved, like two people writing in the same notebook. Nothing corrupts, but the conversation becomes jumbled. Each terminal only sees its own messages during the session, but if you resume that session later, you'll see everything interleaved. For parallel work from the same starting point, use `--fork-session` to give each terminal its own clean session.\n\n### The context window\n\nClaude's context window holds your conversation history, file contents, command outputs, [CLAUDE.md](/en/memory), loaded skills, and system instructions. As you work, context fills up. Claude compacts automatically, but instructions from early in the conversation can get lost. Put persistent rules in CLAUDE.md, and run `/context` to see what's using space.\n\n#### When context fills up\n\nClaude Code manages context automatically as you approach the limit. It clears older tool outputs first, then summarizes the conversation if needed. Your requests and key code snippets are preserved; detailed instructions from early in the conversation may be lost. Put persistent rules in CLAUDE.md rather than relying on conversation history.\n\nTo control what's preserved during compaction, add a \"Compact Instructions\" section to CLAUDE.md or run `/compact` with a focus (like `/compact focus on the API changes`).\n\nRun `/context` to see what's using space. MCP servers add tool definitions to every request, so a few servers can consume significant context before you start working. Run `/mcp` to check per-server costs.\n\n#### Manage context with skills and subagents\n\nBeyond compaction, you can use other features to control what loads into context.\n\n[Skills](/en/skills) load on demand. Claude sees skill descriptions at session start, but the full content only loads when a skill is used. For skills you invoke manually, set `disable-model-invocation: true` to keep descriptions out of context until you need them.\n\n[Subagents](/en/sub-agents) get their own fresh context, completely separate from your main conversation. Their work doesn't bloat your context. When done, they return a summary. This isolation is why subagents help with long sessions.\n\nSee [context costs](/en/features-overview#understand-context-costs) for what each feature costs, and [reduce token usage](/en/costs#reduce-token-usage) for tips on managing context.\n\n## Stay safe with checkpoints and permissions\n\nClaude has two safety mechanisms: checkpoints let you undo file changes, and permissions control what Claude can do without asking.\n\n### Undo changes with checkpoints\n\n**Every file edit is reversible.** Before Claude edits any file, it snapshots the current contents. If something goes wrong, press `Esc` twice to rewind to a previous state, or ask Claude to undo.\n\nCheckpoints are local to your session, separate from git. They only cover file changes. Actions that affect remote systems (databases, APIs, deployments) can't be checkpointed, which is why Claude asks before running commands with external side effects.\n\n### Control what Claude can do\n\nPress `Shift+Tab` to cycle through permission modes:\n\n* **Default**: Claude asks before file edits and shell commands\n* **Auto-accept edits**: Claude edits files without asking, still asks for commands\n* **Plan mode**: Claude uses read-only tools only, creating a plan you can approve before execution\n* **Delegate mode**: Claude coordinates work through [agent teammates](/en/agent-teams) only, with no direct implementation. Only available when an agent team is active.\n\nYou can also allow specific commands in `.claude/settings.json` so Claude doesn't ask each time. This is useful for trusted commands like `npm test` or `git status`. Settings can be scoped from organization-wide policies down to personal preferences. See [Permissions](/en/permissions) for details.\n\n***\n\n## Work effectively with Claude Code\n\nThese tips help you get better results from Claude Code.\n\n### Ask Claude Code for help\n\nClaude Code can teach you how to use it. Ask questions like \"how do I set up hooks?\" or \"what's the best way to structure my CLAUDE.md?\" and Claude will explain.\n\nBuilt-in commands also guide you through setup:\n\n* `/init` walks you through creating a CLAUDE.md for your project\n* `/agents` helps you configure custom subagents\n* `/doctor` diagnoses common issues with your installation\n\n### It's a conversation\n\nClaude Code is conversational. You don't need perfect prompts. Start with what you want, then refine:\n\n```\n> Fix the login bug\n\n[Claude investigates, tries something]\n\n> That's not quite right. The issue is in the session handling.\n\n[Claude adjusts approach]\n```\n\nWhen the first attempt isn't right, you don't start over. You iterate.\n\n#### Interrupt and steer\n\nYou can interrupt Claude at any point. If it's going down the wrong path, just type your correction and press Enter. Claude will stop what it's doing and adjust its approach based on your input. You don't have to wait for it to finish or start over.\n\n### Be specific upfront\n\nThe more precise your initial prompt, the fewer corrections you'll need. Reference specific files, mention constraints, and point to example patterns.\n\n```\n> The checkout flow is broken for users with expired cards.\n> Check src/payments/ for the issue, especially token refresh.\n> Write a failing test first, then fix it.\n```\n\nVague prompts like \"fix the login bug\" work, but you'll spend more time steering. Specific prompts like the above often succeed on the first attempt.\n\n### Give Claude something to verify against\n\nClaude performs better when it can check its own work. Include test cases, paste screenshots of expected UI, or define the output you want.\n\n```\n> Implement validateEmail. Test cases: 'user@example.com' → true,\n> 'invalid' → false, 'user@.com' → false. Run the tests after.\n```\n\nFor visual work, paste a screenshot of the design and ask Claude to compare its implementation against it.\n\n### Explore before implementing\n\nFor complex problems, separate research from coding. Use plan mode (`Shift+Tab` twice) to analyze the codebase first:\n\n```\n> Read src/auth/ and understand how we handle sessions.\n> Then create a plan for adding OAuth support.\n```\n\nReview the plan, refine it through conversation, then let Claude implement. This two-phase approach produces better results than jumping straight to code.\n\n### Delegate, don't dictate\n\nThink of delegating to a capable colleague. Give context and direction, then trust Claude to figure out the details:\n\n```\n> The checkout flow is broken for users with expired cards.\n> The relevant code is in src/payments/. Can you investigate and fix it?\n```\n\nYou don't need to specify which files to read or what commands to run. Claude figures that out.\n\n## What's next\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Extend with features\" icon=\"puzzle-piece\" href=\"/en/features-overview\">\n    Add Skills, MCP connections, and custom commands\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Common workflows\" icon=\"graduation-cap\" href=\"/en/common-workflows\">\n    Step-by-step guides for typical tasks\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}]},"uuid":"dca14d50-8604-4a27-ba4f-c9b7cae15149","timestamp":"2026-02-17T03:55:11.920Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"de190ac5-ed9a-4f54-aaa3-15b10c329197"}

Now I have the complete picture. Let me provide you with a comprehensive technical breakdown of the agent teams architecture.\n\n## Agent Teams Architecture: Beyond Simple Loops\n\nAgent teams is **not** just a loop. It's a distributed system with specific architectural components designed for multi-agent coordination. Here's the technical breakdown:\n\n### 1. What It Actually Is\n\nAgent teams is a **system of multiple independent agentic instances with asynchronous communication and shared state management**. Each teammate runs its own complete agentic loop (gather context → take action → verify results) in isolation with separate context windows, but they're coordinated through:\n\n- Shared task list with file-based locking\n- Message mailbox for inter-agent communication\n- Automatic dependency tracking and blocking\n- Idle notifications and status synchronization\n\n### 2. Core Architecture Components\n\n| Component | Role | Technical Details |\n|-----------|------|-------------------|\n| **Team Lead** | Main session that spawns and coordinates | Manages team lifecycle, approves plans, synthesizes results. First session to run `start agent team` |\n| **Teammates** | Separate Claude Code instances | Each is a full, independent session with own context window. Spawned by lead via API, not subprocesses |\n| **Task List** | Shared work coordination | Stored in `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`. File-based locking prevents race conditions when multiple agents claim tasks simultaneously |\n| **Mailbox** | Message delivery system | Async message queue. Teammates don't block waiting for responses; messages arrive automatically |\n| **Team Config** | Metadata and membership | `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` contains `members` array with teammate IDs, agent types, session IDs |\n\n### 3. How It Differs From Simple Loops\n\n**Simple loop (Ralph Wiggum pattern):**\n```\nwhile not done:\n    generate_next_step()\n    execute()\n    check_if_done()\n```\n\n**Agent teams:**\n- Multiple parallel agentic loops running simultaneously\n- Each loop has independent context window (no shared conversation history)\n- Explicit task dependencies and blocking\n- Asynchronous message passing (non-blocking)\n- File-based coordination for task claiming\n- Automatic idle detection and notifications\n\n### 4. Context Isolation\n\n**Key difference from subagents:**\n- Subagents run *within* a single session and return results back to the main conversation\n- Teammates have **completely independent context windows** - they don't inherit the lead's conversation history\n- When spawned, a teammate loads:\n  - Same CLAUDE.md from the project\n  - MCP servers configured for the project\n  - Skills available to the project\n  - The spawn prompt from the lead (one-way instruction)\n  - NOT the lead's previous messages or context\n\nThis isolation is intentional. It prevents context pollution and allows each teammate to focus on their own task without being influenced by the lead's previous approaches.\n\n### 5. Communication & Coordination Model\n\n**Messaging:**\n- Teammates send messages: `message @teammate \"what did you find?\"`\n- Broadcast to all: `broadcast \"team update...\"`\n- Messages are **asynchronous** - senders don't wait for responses\n- Lead receives notifications automatically when teammates go idle\n\n**Task Coordination:**\n- Lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them (or teammates self-claim)\n- Tasks stored as files in `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`\n- Task state: `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`\n- Task dependencies tracked automatically - dependent tasks unblock when their prerequisites complete\n- File locking prevents two teammates claiming the same task\n\n**Idle Detection:**\n- When a teammate finishes its current action and has no work, it notifies the lead\n- Lead can respond with new tasks or shut them down\n- TeammateIdle hook fires when idle, allows lead to inject feedback\n\n### 6. Is There a Lead Agent Orchestrating?\n\nYes and no:\n\n**Yes - structural lead:**\n- One session is designated the \"lead\" (the one that spawned the team)\n- Lead has `cleanup()` permissions only it can run\n- Lead handles team initialization and shutdown\n\n**No - not all decisions go through lead:**\n- Teammates self-claim work from shared task list\n- Teammates message each other directly (not routed through lead)\n- Teammates make independent decisions about which tasks to tackle next\n- Lead can't veto teammate decisions in real-time\n\nThink of it as a **lead coordinator with peer-to-peer messaging**, not a hierarchical command structure.\n\n### 7. Context and State Sharing\n\n**What IS shared:**\n- Task list (all agents see all tasks, their status, and dependencies)\n- Mailbox (messages delivered automatically)\n- Project files on disk (all agents see the same filesystem)\n- CLAUDE.md (teammates read project conventions)\n\n**What is NOT shared:**\n- Conversation history (each teammate has its own session history)\n- Context window (each teammate has independent token budget)\n- Learnings or reasoning (teammates don't see each other's thought process, only final messages)\n\n### 8. Multi-Agent Mechanics Under the Hood\n\n**How teammates spawn:**\n- Lead creates teammate via agent API\n- Teammate starts as fresh Claude Code session with unique session ID\n- Team config updated with new member entry\n- Teammate reads team config to discover teammates list\n\n**How they claim tasks:**\n```\nTeammate detects unclaimed task\n→ Attempts to acquire file lock on task\n  (multiple teammates might try simultaneously)\n→ Lock succeeds or fails atomically\n→ If success: mark task in_progress with teammate ID\n→ If fail: try next unclaimed task\n```\n\n**How messages route:**\n```\nTeammate calls message @alice \"update\"\n→ Message written to Alice's mailbox file\n→ Alice's session detects new messages\n→ Message delivered to Alice's context automatically\n→ Alice sees it as a new input in her agentic loop\n```\n\n### 9. Token Usage Implications\n\nAgent teams use **significantly more tokens** than a single session because:\n- Each teammate loads full project context (CLAUDE.md, skills, MCP definitions)\n- Each teammate runs its own agentic loop independently\n- Token usage scales linearly with number of active teammates\n- Each message exchange costs tokens for both sender and receiver\n\nThe docs recommend this is worthwhile for:\n- Research/review (parallel investigation saves time more than it costs tokens)\n- New features (no file conflicts, independent work)\n- Competing hypotheses (parallel exploration finds root cause faster)\n\nBut not for:\n- Routine sequential work\n- Highly interdependent tasks\n- Complex multi-file changes in same files\n\n### 10. How It's Different From Multiple Headless Claude Instances\n\nYou could technically spawn multiple Claude Code instances independently and manage communication yourself. Agent teams gives you:\n\n**Automatic coordination:**\n- File-based task locking (prevents race conditions)\n- Dependency blocking (tasks wait for prerequisites)\n- Idle notifications (lead knows when work is done)\n- Automatic message delivery (no polling)\n\n**Lead management:**\n- Single point to approve/reject plans (`require-plan-approval`)\n- Hook system (TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted hooks for quality gates)\n- Graceful shutdown requests (teammates can refuse)\n- Team cleanup (removes all resources atomically)\n\n**Display integration:**\n- Split-pane mode (each teammate in tmux pane, visible at once)\n- In-process mode (teammates backgrounded, switch with Shift+Up/Down)\n- Unified task list UI in interactive mode\n\nYou'd have to build all this yourself with independent instances.\n\n### 11. Current Limitations (Important)\n\n- **No session resumption with in-process teammates**: `/resume` doesn't restore in-process teammates\n- **One team per session**: A lead can only manage one team at a time\n- **No nested teams**: Teammates can't spawn their own teammates\n- **Lead is fixed**: Can't promote teammate to lead or transfer leadership\n- **No split panes in VS Code terminal**: Only works in standalone terminal with tmux/iTerm2\n- **Task status can lag**: Teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks completed, blocking dependents\n\n## Summary\n\nAgent teams is **not** \"just a loop.\" It's a distributed multi-agent system with:\n1. Independent agentic instances (each runs full loop in isolation)\n2. Asynchronous communication (message mailbox)\n3. Shared state management (task list with file locking)\n4. Automatic dependency coordination\n5. Lead supervision (not hierarchical control)\n6. Peer-to-peer messaging (not all communication routed through lead)\n\nThe architectural value comes from enabling **parallel exploration with automatic coordination** - something that's hard to do with simple loops or independent processes."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5158,"cache_read_input_tokens":29697,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":5158},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYCy1T8X3fp7KwU6cVZDS","type":"assistant","uuid":"63e0babf-40df-418a-ab13-243047801b1b","timestamp":"2026-02-17T03:55:36.355Z"}
