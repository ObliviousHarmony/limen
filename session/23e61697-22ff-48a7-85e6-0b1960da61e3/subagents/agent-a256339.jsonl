With a simple `@claude` mention in any PR or issue, Claude can analyze your code, create pull requests, implement features, and fix bugs - all while following your project's standards.\n\n<Note>\n  Claude Code GitHub Actions is built on top of the [Claude\n  Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), which enables programmatic integration of\n  Claude Code into your applications. You can use the SDK to build custom\n  automation workflows beyond GitHub Actions.\n</Note>\n\n<Info>\n  **Claude Opus 4.6 is now available.** Claude Code GitHub Actions default to Sonnet. To use Opus 4.6, configure the [model parameter](#breaking-changes-reference) to use `claude-opus-4-6`.\n</Info>\n\n## Why use Claude Code GitHub Actions?\n\n* **Instant PR creation**: Describe what you need, and Claude creates a complete PR with all necessary changes\n* **Automated code implementation**: Turn issues into working code with a single command\n* **Follows your standards**: Claude respects your `CLAUDE.md` guidelines and existing code patterns\n* **Simple setup**: Get started in minutes with our installer and API key\n* **Secure by default**: Your code stays on Github's runners\n\n## What can Claude do?\n\nClaude Code provides a powerful GitHub Action that transforms how you work with code:\n\n### Claude Code Action\n\nThis GitHub Action allows you to run Claude Code within your GitHub Actions workflows. You can use this to build any custom workflow on top of Claude Code.\n\n[View repository →](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)\n\n## Setup\n\n## Quick setup\n\nThe easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`.\n\nThis command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.\n\n<Note>\n  * You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets\n  * The GitHub app will request read & write permissions for Contents, Issues, and Pull requests\n  * This quickstart method is only available for direct Claude API users. If\n    you're using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the [Using with AWS\n    Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai)\n    section.\n</Note>\n\n## Manual setup\n\nIf the `/install-github-app` command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:\n\n1. **Install the Claude GitHub app** to your repository: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)\n\n   The Claude GitHub app requires the following repository permissions:\n\n   * **Contents**: Read & write (to modify repository files)\n   * **Issues**: Read & write (to respond to issues)\n   * **Pull requests**: Read & write (to create PRs and push changes)\n\n   For more details on security and permissions, see the [security documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md).\n2. **Add ANTHROPIC\\_API\\_KEY** to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))\n3. **Copy the workflow file** from [examples/claude.yml](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`\n\n<Tip>\n  After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging `@claude` in an issue or PR comment.\n</Tip>\n\n## Upgrading from Beta\n\n<Warning>\n  Claude Code GitHub Actions v1.0 introduces breaking changes that require updating your workflow files in order to upgrade to v1.0 from the beta version.\n</Warning>\n\nIf you're currently using the beta version of Claude Code GitHub Actions, we recommend that you update your workflows to use the GA version. The new version simplifies configuration while adding powerful new features like automatic mode detection.\n\n### Essential changes\n\nAll beta users must make these changes to their workflow files in order to upgrade:\n\n1. **Update the action version**: Change `@beta` to `@v1`\n2. **Remove mode configuration**: Delete `mode: \"tag\"` or `mode: \"agent\"` (now auto-detected)\n3. **Update prompt inputs**: Replace `direct_prompt` with `prompt`\n4. **Move CLI options**: Convert `max_turns`, `model`, `custom_instructions`, etc. to `claude_args`\n\n### Breaking Changes Reference\n\n| Old Beta Input        | New v1.0 Input                        |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| `mode`                | *(Removed - auto-detected)*           |\n| `direct_prompt`       | `prompt`                              |\n| `override_prompt`     | `prompt` with GitHub variables        |\n| `custom_instructions` | `claude_args: --append-system-prompt` |\n| `max_turns`           | `claude_args: --max-turns`            |\n| `model`               | `claude_args: --model`                |\n| `allowed_tools`       | `claude_args: --allowedTools`         |\n| `disallowed_tools`    | `claude_args: --disallowedTools`      |\n| `claude_env`          | `settings` JSON format                |\n\n### Before and After Example\n\n**Beta version:**\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta\n  with:\n    mode: \"tag\"\n    direct_prompt: \"Review this PR for security issues\"\n    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n    custom_instructions: \"Follow our coding standards\"\n    max_turns: \"10\"\n    model: \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\"\n```\n\n**GA version (v1.0):**\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n  with:\n    prompt: \"Review this PR for security issues\"\n    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n    claude_args: |\n      --append-system-prompt \"Follow our coding standards\"\n      --max-turns 10\n      --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  The action now automatically detects whether to run in interactive mode (responds to `@claude` mentions) or automation mode (runs immediately with a prompt) based on your configuration.\n</Tip>\n\n## Example use cases\n\nClaude Code GitHub Actions can help you with a variety of tasks. The [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) contains ready-to-use workflows for different scenarios.\n\n### Basic workflow\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\nname: Claude Code\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n  pull_request_review_comment:\n    types: [created]\njobs:\n  claude:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n          # Responds to @claude mentions in comments\n```\n\n### Using skills\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\nname: Code Review\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, synchronize]\njobs:\n  review:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n          prompt: \"/review\"\n          claude_args: \"--max-turns 5\"\n```\n\n### Custom automation with prompts\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\nname: Daily Report\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \"0 9 * * *\"\njobs:\n  report:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n          prompt: \"Generate a summary of yesterday's commits and open issues\"\n          claude_args: \"--model opus\"\n```\n\n### Common use cases\n\nIn issue or PR comments:\n\n```\n@claude implement this feature based on the issue description\n@claude how should I implement user authentication for this endpoint?\n@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component\n```\n\nClaude will automatically analyze the context and respond appropriately.\n\n## Best practices\n\n### CLAUDE.md configuration\n\nCreate a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude's understanding of your project standards.\n\n### Security considerations\n\n<Warning>Never commit API keys directly to your repository.</Warning>\n\nFor comprehensive security guidance including permissions, authentication, and best practices, see the [Claude Code Action security documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md).\n\nAlways use GitHub Secrets for API keys:\n\n* Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n* Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`\n* Limit action permissions to only what's necessary\n* Review Claude's suggestions before merging\n\nAlways use GitHub Secrets (for example, `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.\n\n### Optimizing performance\n\nUse issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.\n\n### CI costs\n\nWhen using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:\n\n**GitHub Actions costs:**\n\n* Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes\n* See [GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits\n\n**API costs:**\n\n* Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses\n* Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size\n* See [Claude's pricing page](https://claude.com/platform/api) for current token rates\n\n**Cost optimization tips:**\n\n* Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls\n* Configure appropriate `--max-turns` in `claude_args` to prevent excessive iterations\n* Set workflow-level timeouts to avoid runaway jobs\n* Consider using GitHub's concurrency controls to limit parallel runs\n\n## Configuration examples\n\nThe Claude Code Action v1 simplifies configuration with unified parameters:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n  with:\n    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n    prompt: \"Your instructions here\" # Optional\n    claude_args: \"--max-turns 5\" # Optional CLI arguments\n```\n\nKey features:\n\n* **Unified prompt interface** - Use `prompt` for all instructions\n* **Commands** - Prebuilt prompts like `/review` or `/fix`\n* **CLI passthrough** - Any Claude Code CLI argument via `claude_args`\n* **Flexible triggers** - Works with any GitHub event\n\nVisit the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) for complete workflow files.\n\n<Tip>\n  When responding to issue or PR comments, Claude automatically responds to @claude mentions. For other events, use the `prompt` parameter to provide instructions.\n</Tip>\n\n## Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI\n\nFor enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:\n\n#### For Google Cloud Vertex AI:\n\n1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled\n2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions\n3. A service account with the required permissions\n4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB\\_TOKEN\n\n#### For AWS Bedrock:\n\n1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled\n2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS\n3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions\n4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB\\_TOKEN\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)\">\n    For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:\n\n    1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)\n    2. Fill in the basic information:\n       * **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., \"YourOrg Claude Assistant\")\n       * **Homepage URL**: Your organization's website or the repository URL\n    3. Configure the app settings:\n       * **Webhooks**: Uncheck \"Active\" (not needed for this integration)\n    4. Set the required permissions:\n       * **Repository permissions**:\n         * Contents: Read & Write\n         * Issues: Read & Write\n         * Pull requests: Read & Write\n    5. Click \"Create GitHub App\"\n    6. After creation, click \"Generate a private key\" and save the downloaded `.pem` file\n    7. Note your App ID from the app settings page\n    8. Install the app to your repository:\n       * From your app's settings page, click \"Install App\" in the left sidebar\n       * Select your account or organization\n       * Choose \"Only select repositories\" and select the specific repository\n       * Click \"Install\"\n    9. Add the private key as a secret to your repository:\n       * Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions\n       * Create a new secret named `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the contents of the `.pem` file\n    10. Add the App ID as a secret:\n\n    * Create a new secret named `APP_ID` with your GitHub App's ID\n\n    <Note>\n      This app will be used with the [actions/create-github-app-token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.\n    </Note>\n\n    **Alternative for Claude API or if you don't want to setup your own Github app**: Use the official Anthropic app:\n\n    1.

For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.\n\n## Advanced configuration\n\n### Action parameters\n\nThe Claude Code Action v1 uses a simplified configuration:\n\n| Parameter           | Description                                            | Required |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |\n| `prompt`            | Instructions for Claude (text or skill like `/review`) | No\\*     |\n| `claude_args`       | CLI arguments passed to Claude Code                    | No       |\n| `anthropic_api_key` | Claude API key                                         | Yes\\*\\*  |\n| `github_token`      | GitHub token for API access                            | No       |\n| `trigger_phrase`    | Custom trigger phrase (default: \"@claude\")             | No       |\n| `use_bedrock`       | Use AWS Bedrock instead of Claude API                  | No       |\n| `use_vertex`        | Use Google Vertex AI instead of Claude API             | No       |\n\n\\*Prompt is optional - when omitted for issue/PR comments, Claude responds to trigger phrase\\\n\\*\\*Required for direct Claude API, not for Bedrock/Vertex\n\n#### Pass CLI arguments\n\nThe `claude_args` parameter accepts any Claude Code CLI arguments:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\nclaude_args: \"--max-turns 5 --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 --mcp-config /path/to/config.json\"\n```\n\nCommon arguments:\n\n* `--max-turns`: Maximum conversation turns (default: 10)\n* `--model`: Model to use (for example, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)\n* `--mcp-config`: Path to MCP configuration\n* `--allowed-tools`: Comma-separated list of allowed tools\n* `--debug`: Enable debug output\n\n### Alternative integration methods\n\nWhile the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:\n\n* **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.\n* **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility\n* **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers\n\nSee the [Claude Code Action documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs) for detailed guides on authentication, security, and advanced configuration.\n\n### Customizing Claude's behavior\n\nYou can configure Claude's behavior in two ways:\n\n1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/en/memory) for more details.\n2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude's behavior for different workflows or tasks.\n\nClaude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.\n"}]},"uuid":"d8b72078-7e1e-4bc9-8b37-a68a60ce046a","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:30:17.943Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"df144292-01e5-47e1-8a76-b8a0456f0926"}

It's available as a CLI for scripts and CI/CD, or as [Python](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python) and [TypeScript](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript) packages for full programmatic control.\n\n<Note>\n  The CLI was previously called \"headless mode.\" The `-p` flag and all CLI options work the same way.\n</Note>\n\nTo run Claude Code programmatically from the CLI, pass `-p` with your prompt and any [CLI options](/en/cli-reference):\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Find and fix the bug in auth.py\" --allowedTools \"Read,Edit,Bash\"\n```\n\nThis page covers using the Agent SDK via the CLI (`claude -p`). For the Python and TypeScript SDK packages with structured outputs, tool approval callbacks, and native message objects, see the [full Agent SDK documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview).\n\n## Basic usage\n\nAdd the `-p` (or `--print`) flag to any `claude` command to run it non-interactively. All [CLI options](/en/cli-reference) work with `-p`, including:\n\n* `--continue` for [continuing conversations](#continue-conversations)\n* `--allowedTools` for [auto-approving tools](#auto-approve-tools)\n* `--output-format` for [structured output](#get-structured-output)\n\nThis example asks Claude a question about your codebase and prints the response:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"What does the auth module do?\"\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples highlight common CLI patterns.\n\n### Get structured output\n\nUse `--output-format` to control how responses are returned:\n\n* `text` (default): plain text output\n* `json`: structured JSON with result, session ID, and metadata\n* `stream-json`: newline-delimited JSON for real-time streaming\n\nThis example returns a project summary as JSON with session metadata, with the text result in the `result` field:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Summarize this project\" --output-format json\n```\n\nTo get output conforming to a specific schema, use `--output-format json` with `--json-schema` and a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition. The response includes metadata about the request (session ID, usage, etc.) with the structured output in the `structured_output` field.\n\nThis example extracts function names and returns them as an array of strings:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Extract the main function names from auth.py\" \\\n  --output-format json \\\n  --json-schema '{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"functions\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"functions\"]}'\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Use a tool like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to parse the response and extract specific fields:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  # Extract the text result\n  claude -p \"Summarize this project\" --output-format json | jq -r '.result'\n\n  # Extract structured output\n  claude -p \"Extract function names from auth.py\" \\\n    --output-format json \\\n    --json-schema '{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"functions\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"functions\"]}' \\\n    | jq '.structured_output'\n  ```\n</Tip>\n\n### Stream responses\n\nUse `--output-format stream-json` with `--verbose` and `--include-partial-messages` to receive tokens as they're generated. Each line is a JSON object representing an event:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Explain recursion\" --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages\n```\n\nThe following example uses [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to filter for text deltas and display just the streaming text. The `-r` flag outputs raw strings (no quotes) and `-j` joins without newlines so tokens stream continuously:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Write a poem\" --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages | \\\n  jq -rj 'select(.type == \"stream_event\" and .event.delta.type? == \"text_delta\") | .event.delta.text'\n```\n\nFor programmatic streaming with callbacks and message objects, see [Stream responses in real-time](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-output) in the Agent SDK documentation.\n\n### Auto-approve tools\n\nUse `--allowedTools` to let Claude use certain tools without prompting. This example runs a test suite and fixes failures, allowing Claude to execute Bash commands and read/edit files without asking for permission:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Run the test suite and fix any failures\" \\\n  --allowedTools \"Bash,Read,Edit\"\n```\n\n### Create a commit\n\nThis example reviews staged changes and creates a commit with an appropriate message:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"Look at my staged changes and create an appropriate commit\" \\\n  --allowedTools \"Bash(git diff *),Bash(git log *),Bash(git status *),Bash(git commit *)\"\n```\n\nThe `--allowedTools` flag uses [permission rule syntax](/en/settings#permission-rule-syntax). The trailing ` *` enables prefix matching, so `Bash(git diff *)` allows any command starting with `git diff`. The space before `*` is important: without it, `Bash(git diff*)` would also match `git diff-index`.\n\n<Note>\n  User-invoked [skills](/en/skills) like `/commit` and [built-in commands](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands) are only available in interactive mode. In `-p` mode, describe the task you want to accomplish instead.\n</Note>\n\n### Customize the system prompt\n\nUse `--append-system-prompt` to add instructions while keeping Claude Code's default behavior. This example pipes a PR diff to Claude and instructs it to review for security vulnerabilities:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ngh pr diff \"$1\" | claude -p \\\n  --append-system-prompt \"You are a security engineer. Review for vulnerabilities.\" \\\n  --output-format json\n```\n\nSee [system prompt flags](/en/cli-reference#system-prompt-flags) for more options including `--system-prompt` to fully replace the default prompt.\n\n### Continue conversations\n\nUse `--continue` to continue the most recent conversation, or `--resume` with a session ID to continue a specific conversation. This example runs a review, then sends follow-up prompts:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# First request\nclaude -p \"Review this codebase for performance issues\"\n\n# Continue the most recent conversation\nclaude -p \"Now focus on the database queries\" --continue\nclaude -p \"Generate a summary of all issues found\" --continue\n```\n\nIf you're running multiple conversations, capture the session ID to resume a specific one:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nsession_id=$(claude -p \"Start a review\" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id')\nclaude -p \"Continue that review\" --resume \"$session_id\"\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Agent SDK quickstart\" icon=\"play\" href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart\">\n    Build your first agent with Python or TypeScript\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"CLI reference\" icon=\"terminal\" href=\"/en/cli-reference\">\n    Explore all CLI flags and options\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"GitHub Actions\" icon=\"github\" href=\"/en/github-actions\">\n    Use the Agent SDK in GitHub workflows\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"GitLab CI/CD\" icon=\"gitlab\" href=\"/en/gitlab-ci-cd\">\n    Use the Agent SDK in GitLab pipelines\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}]},"uuid":"debf1371-360a-4703-8736-d42397d5c615","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:30:17.969Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4875f679-d7ce-4205-9792-bdc4c1085a1e"}

Unlike a chatbot that answers questions and waits, Claude Code can read your files, run commands, make changes, and autonomously work through problems while you watch, redirect, or step away entirely.\n\nThis changes how you work. Instead of writing code yourself and asking Claude to review it, you describe what you want and Claude figures out how to build it. Claude explores, plans, and implements.\n\nBut this autonomy still comes with a learning curve. Claude works within certain constraints you need to understand.\n\nThis guide covers patterns that have proven effective across Anthropic's internal teams and for engineers using Claude Code across various codebases, languages, and environments. For how the agentic loop works under the hood, see [How Claude Code works](/en/how-claude-code-works).\n\n***\n\nMost best practices are based on one constraint: Claude's context window fills up fast, and performance degrades as it fills.\n\nClaude's context window holds your entire conversation, including every message, every file Claude reads, and every command output. However, this can fill up fast. A single debugging session or codebase exploration might generate and consume tens of thousands of tokens.\n\nThis matters since LLM performance degrades as context fills. When the context window is getting full, Claude may start \"forgetting\" earlier instructions or making more mistakes. The context window is the most important resource to manage. Track context usage continuously with a [custom status line](/en/statusline), and see [Reduce token usage](/en/costs#reduce-token-usage) for strategies on reducing token usage.\n\n***\n\n## Give Claude a way to verify its work\n\n<Tip>\n  Include tests, screenshots, or expected outputs so Claude can check itself. This is the single highest-leverage thing you can do.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude performs dramatically better when it can verify its own work, like run tests, compare screenshots, and validate outputs.\n\nWithout clear success criteria, it might produce something that looks right but actually doesn't work. You become the only feedback loop, and every mistake requires your attention.\n\n| Strategy                              | Before                                                  | After                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Provide verification criteria**     | *\"implement a function that validates email addresses\"* | *\"write a validateEmail function. example test cases: [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com) is true, invalid is false, [user@.com](mailto:user@.com) is false. run the tests after implementing\"* |\n| **Verify UI changes visually**        | *\"make the dashboard look better\"*                      | *\"\\[paste screenshot] implement this design. take a screenshot of the result and compare it to the original. list differences and fix them\"*                                                            |\n| **Address root causes, not symptoms** | *\"the build is failing\"*                                | *\"the build fails with this error: \\[paste error]. fix it and verify the build succeeds. address the root cause, don't suppress the error\"*                                                             |\n\nUI changes can be verified using the [Claude in Chrome extension](/en/chrome). It opens new tabs in your browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works.\n\nYour verification can also be a test suite, a linter, or a Bash command that checks output. Invest in making your verification rock-solid.\n\n***\n\n## Explore first, then plan, then code\n\n<Tip>\n  Separate research and planning from implementation to avoid solving the wrong problem.\n</Tip>\n\nLetting Claude jump straight to coding can produce code that solves the wrong problem. Use [Plan Mode](/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis) to separate exploration from execution.\n\nThe recommended workflow has four phases:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Explore\">\n    Enter Plan Mode. Claude reads files and answers questions without making changes.\n\n    ```txt claude (Plan Mode) theme={null}\n    read /src/auth and understand how we handle sessions and login.\n    also look at how we manage environment variables for secrets.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Plan\">\n    Ask Claude to create a detailed implementation plan.\n\n    ```txt claude (Plan Mode) theme={null}\n    I want to add Google OAuth. What files need to change?\n    What's the session flow? Create a plan.\n    ```\n\n    Press `Ctrl+G` to open the plan in your text editor for direct editing before Claude proceeds.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Implement\">\n    Switch back to Normal Mode and let Claude code, verifying against its plan.\n\n    ```txt claude (Normal Mode) theme={null}\n    implement the OAuth flow from your plan. write tests for the\n    callback handler, run the test suite and fix any failures.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Commit\">\n    Ask Claude to commit with a descriptive message and create a PR.\n\n    ```txt claude (Normal Mode) theme={null}\n    commit with a descriptive message and open a PR\n    ```\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Callout>\n  Plan Mode is useful, but also adds overhead.\n\n  For tasks where the scope is clear and the fix is small (like fixing a typo, adding a log line, or renaming a variable) ask Claude to do it directly.\n\n  Planning is most useful when you're uncertain about the approach, when the change modifies multiple files, or when you're unfamiliar with the code being modified. If you could describe the diff in one sentence, skip the plan.\n</Callout>\n\n***\n\n## Provide specific context in your prompts\n\n<Tip>\n  The more precise your instructions, the fewer corrections you'll need.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude can infer intent, but it can't read your mind. Reference specific files, mention constraints, and point to example patterns.\n\n| Strategy                                                                                         | Before                                               | After                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Scope the task.** Specify which file, what scenario, and testing preferences.                  | *\"add tests for foo.py\"*                             | *\"write a test for foo.py covering the edge case where the user is logged out. avoid mocks.\"*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| **Point to sources.** Direct Claude to the source that can answer a question.                    | *\"why does ExecutionFactory have such a weird api?\"* | *\"look through ExecutionFactory's git history and summarize how its api came to be\"*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **Reference existing patterns.** Point Claude to patterns in your codebase.                      | *\"add a calendar widget\"*                            | *\"look at how existing widgets are implemented on the home page to understand the patterns. HotDogWidget.php is a good example. follow the pattern to implement a new calendar widget that lets the user select a month and paginate forwards/backwards to pick a year. build from scratch without libraries other than the ones already used in the codebase.\"* |\n| **Describe the symptom.** Provide the symptom, the likely location, and what \"fixed\" looks like. | *\"fix the login bug\"*                                | *\"users report that login fails after session timeout. check the auth flow in src/auth/, especially token refresh. write a failing test that reproduces the issue, then fix it\"*                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\nVague prompts can be useful when you're exploring and can afford to course-correct. A prompt like `\"what would you improve in this file?\"` can surface things you wouldn't have thought to ask about.\n\n### Provide rich content\n\n<Tip>\n  Use `@` to reference files, paste screenshots/images, or pipe data directly.\n</Tip>\n\nYou can provide rich data to Claude in several ways:\n\n* **Reference files with `@`** instead of describing where code lives. Claude reads the file before responding.\n* **Paste images directly**. Copy/paste or drag and drop images into the prompt.\n* **Give URLs** for documentation and API references. Use `/permissions` to allowlist frequently-used domains.\n* **Pipe in data** by running `cat error.log | claude` to send file contents directly.\n* **Let Claude fetch what it needs**. Tell Claude to pull context itself using Bash commands, MCP tools, or by reading files.\n\n***\n\n## Configure your environment\n\nA few setup steps make Claude Code significantly more effective across all your sessions. For a full overview of extension features and when to use each one, see [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview).\n\n### Write an effective CLAUDE.md\n\n<Tip>\n  Run `/init` to generate a starter CLAUDE.md file based on your current project structure, then refine over time.\n</Tip>\n\nCLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude reads at the start of every conversation. Include Bash commands, code style, and workflow rules. This gives Claude persistent context **it can't infer from code alone**.\n\nThe `/init` command analyzes your codebase to detect build systems, test frameworks, and code patterns, giving you a solid foundation to refine.\n\nThere's no required format for CLAUDE.md files, but keep it short and human-readable. For example:\n\n```markdown CLAUDE.md theme={null}\n# Code style\n- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)\n- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')\n\n# Workflow\n- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes\n- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance\n```\n\nCLAUDE.md is loaded every session, so only include things that apply broadly. For domain knowledge or workflows that are only relevant sometimes, use [skills](/en/skills) instead. Claude loads them on demand without bloating every conversation.\n\nKeep it concise. For each line, ask: *\"Would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?\"* If not, cut it. Bloated CLAUDE.md files cause Claude to ignore your actual instructions!\n\n| ✅ Include                                            | ❌ Exclude                                          |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bash commands Claude can't guess                     | Anything Claude can figure out by reading code     |\n| Code style rules that differ from defaults           | Standard language conventions Claude already knows |\n| Testing instructions and preferred test runners      | Detailed API documentation (link to docs instead)  |\n| Repository etiquette (branch naming, PR conventions) | Information that changes frequently                |\n| Architectural decisions specific to your project     | Long explanations or tutorials                     |\n| Developer environment quirks (required env vars)     | File-by-file descriptions of the codebase          |\n| Common gotchas or non-obvious behaviors              | Self-evident practices like \"write clean code\"     |\n\nIf Claude keeps doing something you don't want despite having a rule against it, the file is probably too long and the rule is getting lost. If Claude asks you questions that are answered in CLAUDE.md, the phrasing might be ambiguous. Treat CLAUDE.md like code: review it when things go wrong, prune it regularly, and test changes by observing whether Claude's behavior actually shifts.\n\nYou can tune instructions by adding emphasis (e.g., \"IMPORTANT\" or \"YOU MUST\") to improve adherence. Check CLAUDE.md into git so your team can contribute. The file compounds in value over time.\n\nCLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax:\n\n```markdown CLAUDE.md theme={null}\nSee @README.md for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands.\n\n# Additional Instructions\n- Git workflow: @docs/git-instructions.md\n- Personal overrides: @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md\n```\n\nYou can place CLAUDE.md files in several locations:\n\n* **Home folder (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)**: Applies to all Claude sessions\n* **Project root (`./CLAUDE.md`)**: Check into git to share with your team, or name it `CLAUDE.local.md` and `.gitignore` it\n* **Parent directories**: Useful for monorepos where both `root/CLAUDE.md` and `root/foo/CLAUDE.md` are pulled in automatically\n* **Child directories**: Claude pulls in child CLAUDE.md files on demand when working with files in those directories\n\n### Configure permissions\n\n<Tip>\n  Use `/permissions` to allowlist safe commands or `/sandbox` for OS-level isolation. This reduces interruptions while keeping you in control.\n</Tip>\n\nBy default, Claude Code requests permission for actions that might modify your system: file writes, Bash commands, MCP tools, etc. This is safe but tedious. After the tenth approval you're not really reviewing anymore, you're just clicking through. There are two ways to reduce these interruptions:\n\n* **Permission allowlists**: Permit specific tools you know are safe (like `npm run lint` or `git commit`)\n* **Sandboxing**: Enable OS-level isolation that restricts filesystem and network access, allowing Claude to work more freely within defined boundaries\n\nAlternatively, use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass all permission checks for contained workflows like fixing lint errors or generating boilerplate.\n\n<Warning>\n  Letting Claude run arbitrary commands can result in data loss, system corruption, or data exfiltration via prompt injection. Only use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in a sandbox without internet access.\n</Warning>\n\nRead more about [configuring permissions](/en/settings) and [enabling sandboxing](/en/sandboxing#sandboxing).\n\n### Use CLI tools\n\n<Tip>\n  Tell Claude Code to use CLI tools like `gh`, `aws`, `gcloud`, and `sentry-cli` when interacting with external services.\n</Tip>\n\nCLI tools are the most context-efficient way to interact with external services. If you use GitHub, install the `gh` CLI. Claude knows how to use it for creating issues, opening pull requests, and reading comments. Without `gh`, Claude can still use the GitHub API, but unauthenticated requests often hit rate limits.\n\nClaude is also effective at learning CLI tools it doesn't already know. Try prompts like `Use 'foo-cli-tool --help' to learn about foo tool, then use it to solve A, B, C.`\n\n### Connect MCP servers\n\n<Tip>\n  Run `claude mcp add` to connect external tools like Notion, Figma, or your database.\n</Tip>\n\nWith [MCP servers](/en/mcp), you can ask Claude to implement features from issue trackers, query databases, analyze monitoring data, integrate designs from Figma, and automate workflows.\n\n### Set up hooks\n\n<Tip>\n  Use hooks for actions that must happen every time with zero exceptions.\n</Tip>\n\n[Hooks](/en/hooks-guide) run scripts automatically at specific points in Claude's workflow. Unlike CLAUDE.md instructions which are advisory, hooks are deterministic and guarantee the action happens.\n\nClaude can write hooks for you. Try prompts like *\"Write a hook that runs eslint after every file edit\"* or *\"Write a hook that blocks writes to the migrations folder.\"* Run `/hooks` for interactive configuration, or edit `.claude/settings.json` directly.\n\n### Create skills\n\n<Tip>\n  Create `SKILL.md` files in `.claude/skills/` to give Claude domain knowledge and reusable workflows.\n</Tip>\n\n[Skills](/en/skills) extend Claude's knowledge with information specific to your project, team, or domain. Claude applies them automatically when relevant, or you can invoke them directly with `/skill-name`.\n\nCreate a skill by adding a directory with a `SKILL.md` to `.claude/skills/`:\n\n```markdown .claude/skills/api-conventions/SKILL.md theme={null}\n---\nname: api-conventions\ndescription: REST API design conventions for our services\n---\n# API Conventions\n- Use kebab-case for URL paths\n- Use camelCase for JSON properties\n- Always include pagination for list endpoints\n- Version APIs in the URL path (/v1/, /v2/)\n```\n\nSkills can also define repeatable workflows you invoke directly:\n\n```markdown .claude/skills/fix-issue/SKILL.md theme={null}\n---\nname: fix-issue\ndescription: Fix a GitHub issue\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\nAnalyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.\n\n1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details\n2. Understand the problem described in the issue\n3. Search the codebase for relevant files\n4. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue\n5. Write and run tests to verify the fix\n6. Ensure code passes linting and type checking\n7. Create a descriptive commit message\n8. Push and create a PR\n```\n\nRun `/fix-issue 1234` to invoke it. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for workflows with side effects that you want to trigger manually.\n\n### Create custom subagents\n\n<Tip>\n  Define specialized assistants in `.claude/agents/` that Claude can delegate to for isolated tasks.\n</Tip>\n\n[Subagents](/en/sub-agents) run in their own context with their own set of allowed tools. They're useful for tasks that read many files or need specialized focus without cluttering your main conversation.\n\n```markdown .claude/agents/security-reviewer.md theme={null}\n---\nname: security-reviewer\ndescription: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash\nmodel: opus\n---\nYou are a senior security engineer. Review code for:\n- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)\n- Authentication and authorization flaws\n- Secrets or credentials in code\n- Insecure data handling\n\nProvide specific line references and suggested fixes.\n```\n\nTell Claude to use subagents explicitly: *\"Use a subagent to review this code for security issues.\"*\n\n### Install plugins\n\n<Tip>\n  Run `/plugin` to browse the marketplace. Plugins add skills, tools, and integrations without configuration.\n</Tip>\n\n[Plugins](/en/plugins) bundle skills, hooks, subagents, and MCP servers into a single installable unit from the community and Anthropic. If you work with a typed language, install a [code intelligence plugin](/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence) to give Claude precise symbol navigation and automatic error detection after edits.\n\nFor guidance on choosing between skills, subagents, hooks, and MCP, see [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview#match-features-to-your-goal).\n\n***\n\n## Communicate effectively\n\nThe way you communicate with Claude Code significantly impacts the quality of results.\n\n### Ask codebase questions\n\n<Tip>\n  Ask Claude questions you'd ask a senior engineer.\n</Tip>\n\nWhen onboarding to a new codebase, use Claude Code for learning and exploration. You can ask Claude the same sorts of questions you would ask another engineer:\n\n* How does logging work?\n* How do I make a new API endpoint?\n* What does `async move { ... }` do on line 134 of `foo.rs`?\n* What edge cases does `CustomerOnboardingFlowImpl` handle?\n* Why does this code call `foo()` instead of `bar()` on line 333?\n\nUsing Claude Code this way is an effective onboarding workflow, improving ramp-up time and reducing load on other engineers. No special prompting required: ask questions directly.\n\n### Let Claude interview you\n\n<Tip>\n  For larger features, have Claude interview you first. Start with a minimal prompt and ask Claude to interview you using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude asks about things you might not have considered yet, including technical implementation, UI/UX, edge cases, and tradeoffs.\n\n```\nI want to build [brief description]. Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool.\n\nAsk about technical implementation, UI/UX, edge cases, concerns, and tradeoffs. Don't ask obvious questions, dig into the hard parts I might not have considered.\n\nKeep interviewing until we've covered everything, then write a complete spec to SPEC.md.\n```\n\nOnce the spec is complete, start a fresh session to execute it. The new session has clean context focused entirely on implementation, and you have a written spec to reference.\n\n***\n\n## Manage your session\n\nConversations are persistent and reversible. Use this to your advantage!\n\n### Course-correct early and often\n\n<Tip>\n  Correct Claude as soon as you notice it going off track.\n</Tip>\n\nThe best results come from tight feedback loops. Though Claude occasionally solves problems perfectly on the first attempt, correcting it quickly generally produces better solutions faster.\n\n* **`Esc`**: Stop Claude mid-action with the `Esc` key. Context is preserved, so you can redirect.\n* **`Esc + Esc` or `/rewind`**: Press `Esc` twice or run `/rewind` to open the rewind menu and restore previous conversation and code state, or summarize from a selected message.\n* **`\"Undo that\"`**: Have Claude revert its changes.\n* **`/clear`**: Reset context between unrelated tasks. Long sessions with irrelevant context can reduce performance.\n\nIf you've corrected Claude more than twice on the same issue in one session, the context is cluttered with failed approaches. Run `/clear` and start fresh with a more specific prompt that incorporates what you learned. A clean session with a better prompt almost always outperforms a long session with accumulated corrections.\n\n### Manage context aggressively\n\n<Tip>\n  Run `/clear` between unrelated tasks to reset context.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude Code automatically compacts conversation history when you approach context limits, which preserves important code and decisions while freeing space.\n\nDuring long sessions, Claude's context window can fill with irrelevant conversation, file contents, and commands. This can reduce performance and sometimes distract Claude.\n\n* Use `/clear` frequently between tasks to reset the context window entirely\n* When auto compaction triggers, Claude summarizes what matters most, including code patterns, file states, and key decisions\n* For more control, run `/compact <instructions>`, like `/compact Focus on the API changes`\n* To compact only part of the conversation, use `Esc + Esc` or `/rewind`, select a message checkpoint, and choose **Summarize from here**. This condenses messages from that point forward while keeping earlier context intact.\n* Customize compaction behavior in CLAUDE.md with instructions like `\"When compacting, always preserve the full list of modified files and any test commands\"` to ensure critical context survives summarization\n\n### Use subagents for investigation\n\n<Tip>\n  Delegate research with `\"use subagents to investigate X\"`. They explore in a separate context, keeping your main conversation clean for implementation.\n</Tip>\n\nSince context is your fundamental constraint, subagents are one of the most powerful tools available. When Claude researches a codebase it reads lots of files, all of which consume your context. Subagents run in separate context windows and report back summaries:\n\n```\nUse subagents to investigate how our authentication system handles token\nrefresh, and whether we have any existing OAuth utilities I should reuse.\n```\n\nThe subagent explores the codebase, reads relevant files, and reports back with findings, all without cluttering your main conversation.\n\nYou can also use subagents for verification after Claude implements something:\n\n```\nuse a subagent to review this code for edge cases\n```\n\n### Rewind with checkpoints\n\n<Tip>\n  Every action Claude makes creates a checkpoint. You can restore conversation, code, or both to any previous checkpoint.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude automatically checkpoints before changes. Double-tap `Escape` or run `/rewind` to open the rewind menu. You can restore conversation only, restore code only, restore both, or summarize from a selected message. See [Checkpointing](/en/checkpointing) for details.\n\nInstead of carefully planning every move, you can tell Claude to try something risky. If it doesn't work, rewind and try a different approach. Checkpoints persist across sessions, so you can close your terminal and still rewind later.\n\n<Warning>\n  Checkpoints only track changes made *by Claude*, not external processes. This isn't a replacement for git.\n</Warning>\n\n### Resume conversations\n\n<Tip>\n  Run `claude --continue` to pick up where you left off, or `--resume` to choose from recent sessions.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude Code saves conversations locally. When a task spans multiple sessions (you start a feature, get interrupted, come back the next day) you don't have to re-explain the context:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --continue    # Resume the most recent conversation\nclaude --resume      # Select from recent conversations\n```\n\nUse `/rename` to give sessions descriptive names (`\"oauth-migration\"`, `\"debugging-memory-leak\"`) so you can find them later. Treat sessions like branches. Different workstreams can have separate, persistent contexts.\n\n***\n\n## Automate and scale\n\nOnce you're effective with one Claude, multiply your output with parallel sessions, headless mode, and fan-out patterns.\n\nEverything so far assumes one human, one Claude, and one conversation. But Claude Code scales horizontally. The techniques in this section show how you can get more done.\n\n### Run headless mode\n\n<Tip>\n  Use `claude -p \"prompt\"` in CI, pre-commit hooks, or scripts. Add `--output-format stream-json` for streaming JSON output.\n</Tip>\n\nWith `claude -p \"your prompt\"`, you can run Claude headlessly, without an interactive session. Headless mode is how you integrate Claude into CI pipelines, pre-commit hooks, or any automated workflow. The output formats (plain text, JSON, streaming JSON) let you parse results programmatically.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# One-off queries\nclaude -p \"Explain what this project does\"\n\n# Structured output for scripts\nclaude -p \"List all API endpoints\" --output-format json\n\n# Streaming for real-time processing\nclaude -p \"Analyze this log file\" --output-format stream-json\n```\n\n### Run multiple Claude sessions\n\n<Tip>\n  Run multiple Claude sessions in parallel to speed up development, run isolated experiments, or start complex workflows.\n</Tip>\n\nThere are three main ways to run parallel sessions:\n\n* [Claude Code desktop app](/en/desktop#work-in-parallel-with-sessions): Manage multiple local sessions visually. Each session gets its own isolated worktree.\n* [Claude Code on the web](/en/claude-code-on-the-web): Run on Anthropic's secure cloud infrastructure in isolated VMs.\n* [Agent teams](/en/agent-teams): Automated coordination of multiple sessions with shared tasks, messaging, and a team lead.\n\nBeyond parallelizing work, multiple sessions enable quality-focused workflows. A fresh context improves code review since Claude won't be biased toward code it just wrote.\n\nFor example, use a Writer/Reviewer pattern:\n\n| Session A (Writer)                                                      | Session B (Reviewer)                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `Implement a rate limiter for our API endpoints`                        |                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                                                         | `Review the rate limiter implementation in @src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts. Look for edge cases, race conditions, and consistency with our existing middleware patterns.` |\n| `Here's the review feedback: [Session B output]. Address these issues.` |                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\nYou can do something similar with tests: have one Claude write tests, then another write code to pass them.\n\n### Fan out across files\n\n<Tip>\n  Loop through tasks calling `claude -p` for each. Use `--allowedTools` to scope permissions for batch operations.\n</Tip>\n\nFor large migrations or analyses, you can distribute work across many parallel Claude invocations:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Generate a task list\">\n    Have Claude list all files that need migrating (e.g., `list all 2,000 Python files that need migrating`)\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Write a script to loop through the list\">\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    for file in $(cat files.txt); do\n      claude -p \"Migrate $file from React to Vue. Return OK or FAIL.\" \\\n        --allowedTools \"Edit,Bash(git commit *)\"\n    done\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test on a few files, then run at scale\">\n    Refine your prompt based on what goes wrong with the first 2-3 files, then run on the full set. The `--allowedTools` flag restricts what Claude can do, which matters when you're running unattended.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nYou can also integrate Claude into existing data/processing pipelines:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude -p \"<your prompt>\" --output-format json | your_command\n```\n\nUse `--verbose` for debugging during development, and turn it off in production.\n\n### Safe Autonomous Mode\n\nUse `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass all permission checks and let Claude work uninterrupted. This works well for workflows like fixing lint errors or generating boilerplate code.\n\n<Warning>\n  Letting Claude run arbitrary commands is risky and can result in data loss, system corruption, or data exfiltration (e.g., via prompt injection attacks). To minimize these risks, use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in a container without internet access.\n\n  With sandboxing enabled (`/sandbox`), you get similar autonomy with better security. Sandbox defines upfront boundaries rather than bypassing all checks.\n</Warning>\n\n***\n\n## Avoid common failure patterns\n\nThese are common mistakes. Recognizing them early saves time:\n\n* **The kitchen sink session.** You start with one task, then ask Claude something unrelated, then go back to the first task. Context is full of irrelevant information.\n  > **Fix**: `/clear` between unrelated tasks.\n* **Correcting over and over.** Claude does something wrong, you correct it, it's still wrong, you correct again. Context is polluted with failed approaches.\n  > **Fix**: After two failed corrections, `/clear` and write a better initial prompt incorporating what you learned.\n* **The over-specified CLAUDE.md.** If your CLAUDE.md is too long, Claude ignores half of it because important rules get lost in the noise.\n  > **Fix**: Ruthlessly prune. If Claude already does something correctly without the instruction, delete it or convert it to a hook.\n* **The trust-then-verify gap.** Claude produces a plausible-looking implementation that doesn't handle edge cases.\n  > **Fix**: Always provide verification (tests, scripts, screenshots). If you can't verify it, don't ship it.\n* **The infinite exploration.** You ask Claude to \"investigate\" something without scoping it. Claude reads hundreds of files, filling the context.\n  > **Fix**: Scope investigations narrowly or use subagents so the exploration doesn't consume your main context.\n\n***\n\n## Develop your intuition\n\nThe patterns in this guide aren't set in stone. They're starting points that work well in general, but might not be optimal for every situation.\n\nSometimes you *should* let context accumulate because you're deep in one complex problem and the history is valuable. Sometimes you should skip planning and let Claude figure it out because the task is exploratory. Sometimes a vague prompt is exactly right because you want to see how Claude interprets the problem before constraining it.\n\nPay attention to what works. When Claude produces great output, notice what you did: the prompt structure, the context you provided, the mode you were in. When Claude struggles, ask why. Was the context too noisy? The prompt too vague? The task too big for one pass?\n\nOver time, you'll develop intuition that no guide can capture. You'll know when to be specific and when to be open-ended, when to plan and when to explore, when to clear context and when to let it accumulate.\n\n## Related resources\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"How Claude Code works\" icon=\"gear\" href=\"/en/how-claude-code-works\">\n    Understand the agentic loop, tools, and context management\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Extend Claude Code\" icon=\"puzzle-piece\" href=\"/en/features-overview\">\n    Choose between skills, hooks, MCP, subagents, and plugins\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Common workflows\" icon=\"list-check\" href=\"/en/common-workflows\">\n    Step-by-step recipes for debugging, testing, PRs, and more\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"CLAUDE.md\" icon=\"file-lines\" href=\"/en/memory\">\n    Store project conventions and persistent context\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}]},"uuid":"a12c14ce-7328-42a3-b614-27ef01143c04","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:30:17.999Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3974ecf0-5fdb-4d62-9822-5a44ba1510a8"}

Enable them by adding `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` to your [settings.json](/en/settings) or environment. Agent teams have [known limitations](#limitations) around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behavior.\n</Warning>\n\nAgent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances working together. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results. Teammates work independently, each in its own context window, and communicate directly with each other.\n\nUnlike [subagents](/en/sub-agents), which run within a single session and can only report back to the main agent, you can also interact with individual teammates directly without going through the lead.\n\nThis page covers:\n\n* [When to use agent teams](#when-to-use-agent-teams), including best use cases and how they compare with subagents\n* [Starting a team](#start-your-first-agent-team)\n* [Controlling teammates](#control-your-agent-team), including display modes, task assignment, and delegation\n* [Best practices for parallel work](#best-practices)\n\n## When to use agent teams\n\nAgent teams are most effective for tasks where parallel exploration adds real value. See [use case examples](#use-case-examples) for full scenarios. The strongest use cases are:\n\n* **Research and review**: multiple teammates can investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then share and challenge each other's findings\n* **New modules or features**: teammates can each own a separate piece without stepping on each other\n* **Debugging with competing hypotheses**: teammates test different theories in parallel and converge on the answer faster\n* **Cross-layer coordination**: changes that span frontend, backend, and tests, each owned by a different teammate\n\nAgent teams add coordination overhead and use significantly more tokens than a single session. They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, same-file edits, or work with many dependencies, a single session or [subagents](/en/sub-agents) are more effective.\n\n### Compare with subagents\n\nBoth agent teams and [subagents](/en/sub-agents) let you parallelize work, but they operate differently. Choose based on whether your workers need to communicate with each other:\n\n<Frame caption=\"Subagents only report results back to the main agent and never talk to each other.

Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work based on your prompt.\n\nThis example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other:\n\n```\nI'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across\ntheir codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one\nteammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.\n```\n\nFrom there, Claude creates a team with a [shared task list](/en/interactive-mode#task-list), spawns teammates for each perspective, has them explore the problem, synthesizes findings, and attempts to [clean up the team](#clean-up-the-team) when finished.\n\nThe lead's terminal lists all teammates and what they're working on. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and message them directly.\n\nIf you want each teammate in its own split pane, see [Choose a display mode](#choose-a-display-mode).\n\n## Control your agent team\n\nTell the lead what you want in natural language. It handles team coordination, task assignment, and delegation based on your instructions.\n\n### Choose a display mode\n\nAgent teams support two display modes:\n\n* **In-process**: all teammates run inside your main terminal. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and type to message them directly. Works in any terminal, no extra setup required.\n* **Split panes**: each teammate gets its own pane. You can see everyone's output at once and click into a pane to interact directly. Requires tmux, or iTerm2.\n\n<Note>\n  `tmux` has known limitations on certain operating systems and traditionally works best on macOS. Using `tmux -CC` in iTerm2 is the suggested entrypoint into `tmux`.\n</Note>\n\nThe default is `\"auto\"`, which uses split panes if you're already running inside a tmux session, and in-process otherwise. The `\"tmux\"` setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects whether to use tmux or iTerm2 based on your terminal. To override, set `teammateMode` in your [settings.json](/en/settings):\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"teammateMode\": \"in-process\"\n}\n```\n\nTo force in-process mode for a single session, pass it as a flag:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --teammate-mode in-process\n```\n\nSplit-pane mode requires either [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or iTerm2 with the [`it2` CLI](https://github.com/mkusaka/it2). To install manually:\n\n* **tmux**: install through your system's package manager. See the [tmux wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) for platform-specific instructions.\n* **iTerm2**: install the [`it2` CLI](https://github.com/mkusaka/it2), then enable the Python API in **iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API**.\n\n### Specify teammates and models\n\nClaude decides the number of teammates to spawn based on your task, or you can specify exactly what you want:\n\n```\nCreate a team with 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.\nUse Sonnet for each teammate.\n```\n\n### Require plan approval for teammates\n\nFor complex or risky tasks, you can require teammates to plan before implementing. The teammate works in read-only plan mode until the lead approves their approach:\n\n```\nSpawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.\nRequire plan approval before they make any changes.\n```\n\nWhen a teammate finishes planning, it sends a plan approval request to the lead. The lead reviews the plan and either approves it or rejects it with feedback. If rejected, the teammate stays in plan mode, revises based on the feedback, and resubmits. Once approved, the teammate exits plan mode and begins implementation.\n\nThe lead makes approval decisions autonomously. To influence the lead's judgment, give it criteria in your prompt, such as \"only approve plans that include test coverage\" or \"reject plans that modify the database schema.\"\n\n### Use delegate mode\n\nWithout delegate mode, the lead sometimes starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. Delegate mode prevents this by restricting the lead to coordination-only tools: spawning, messaging, shutting down teammates, and managing tasks.\n\nThis is useful when you want the lead to focus entirely on orchestration, such as breaking down work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results, without touching code directly.\n\nTo enable it, start a team first, then press Shift+Tab to cycle into delegate mode.\n\n### Talk to teammates directly\n\nEach teammate is a full, independent Claude Code session. You can message any teammate directly to give additional instructions, ask follow-up questions, or redirect their approach.\n\n* **In-process mode**: use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate, then type to send them a message. Press Enter to view a teammate's session, then Escape to interrupt their current turn. Press Ctrl+T to toggle the task list.\n* **Split-pane mode**: click into a teammate's pane to interact with their session directly. Each teammate has a full view of their own terminal.\n\n### Assign and claim tasks\n\nThe shared task list coordinates work across the team. The lead creates tasks and teammates work through them. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, and completed. Tasks can also depend on other tasks: a pending task with unresolved dependencies cannot be claimed until those dependencies are completed.\n\nThe lead can assign tasks explicitly, or teammates can self-claim:\n\n* **Lead assigns**: tell the lead which task to give to which teammate\n* **Self-claim**: after finishing a task, a teammate picks up the next unassigned, unblocked task on its own\n\nTask claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple teammates try to claim the same task simultaneously.\n\n### Shut down teammates\n\nTo gracefully end a teammate's session:\n\n```\nAsk the researcher teammate to shut down\n```\n\nThe lead sends a shutdown request. The teammate can approve, exiting gracefully, or reject with an explanation.\n\n### Clean up the team\n\nWhen you're done, ask the lead to clean up:\n\n```\nClean up the team\n```\n\nThis removes the shared team resources. When the lead runs cleanup, it checks for active teammates and fails if any are still running, so shut them down first.\n\n<Warning>\n  Always use the lead to clean up. Teammates should not run cleanup because their team context may not resolve correctly, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state.\n</Warning>\n\n### Enforce quality gates with hooks\n\nUse [hooks](/en/hooks) to enforce rules when teammates finish work or tasks complete:\n\n* [`TeammateIdle`](/en/hooks#teammateidle): runs when a teammate is about to go idle. Exit with code 2 to send feedback and keep the teammate working.\n* [`TaskCompleted`](/en/hooks#taskcompleted): runs when a task is being marked complete. Exit with code 2 to prevent completion and send feedback.\n\n## How agent teams work\n\nThis section covers the architecture and mechanics behind agent teams. If you want to start using them, see [Control your agent team](#control-your-agent-team) above.\n\n### How Claude starts agent teams\n\nThere are two ways agent teams get started:\n\n* **You request a team**: give Claude a task that benefits from parallel work and explicitly ask for an agent team. Claude creates one based on your instructions.\n* **Claude proposes a team**: if Claude determines your task would benefit from parallel work, it may suggest creating a team. You confirm before it proceeds.\n\nIn both cases, you stay in control. Claude won't create a team without your approval.\n\n### Architecture\n\nAn agent team consists of:\n\n| Component     | Role                                                                                       |\n| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Team lead** | The main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work |\n| **Teammates** | Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks                            |\n| **Task list** | Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete                                |\n| **Mailbox**   | Messaging system for communication between agents                                          |\n\nSee [Choose a display mode](#choose-a-display-mode) for display configuration options. Teammate messages arrive at the lead automatically.\n\nThe system manages task dependencies automatically. When a teammate completes a task that other tasks depend on, blocked tasks unblock without manual intervention.\n\nTeams and tasks are stored locally:\n\n* **Team config**: `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`\n* **Task list**: `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`\n\nThe team config contains a `members` array with each teammate's name, agent ID, and agent type. Teammates can read this file to discover other team members.\n\n### Permissions\n\nTeammates start with the lead's permission settings. If the lead runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, all teammates do too. After spawning, you can change individual teammate modes, but you can't set per-teammate modes at spawn time.\n\n### Context and communication\n\nEach teammate has its own context window. When spawned, a teammate loads the same project context as a regular session: CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills. It also receives the spawn prompt from the lead. The lead's conversation history does not carry over.\n\n**How teammates share information:**\n\n* **Automatic message delivery**: when teammates send messages, they're delivered automatically to recipients. The lead doesn't need to poll for updates.\n* **Idle notifications**: when a teammate finishes and stops, they automatically notify the lead.\n* **Shared task list**: all agents can see task status and claim available work.\n\n**Teammate messaging:**\n\n* **message**: send a message to one specific teammate\n* **broadcast**: send to all teammates simultaneously. Use sparingly, as costs scale with team size.\n\n### Token usage\n\nAgent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Each teammate has its own context window, and token usage scales with the number of active teammates. For research, review, and new feature work, the extra tokens are usually worthwhile. For routine tasks, a single session is more cost-effective. See [agent team token costs](/en/costs#agent-team-token-costs) for usage guidance.\n\n## Use case examples\n\nThese examples show how agent teams handle tasks where parallel exploration adds value.\n\n### Run a parallel code review\n\nA single reviewer tends to gravitate toward one type of issue at a time. Splitting review criteria into independent domains means security, performance, and test coverage all get thorough attention simultaneously. The prompt assigns each teammate a distinct lens so they don't overlap:\n\n```\nCreate an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:\n- One focused on security implications\n- One checking performance impact\n- One validating test coverage\nHave them each review and report findings.\n```\n\nEach reviewer works from the same PR but applies a different filter. The lead synthesizes findings across all three after they finish.\n\n### Investigate with competing hypotheses\n\nWhen the root cause is unclear, a single agent tends to find one plausible explanation and stop looking. The prompt fights this by making teammates explicitly adversarial: each one's job is not only to investigate its own theory but to challenge the others'.\n\n```\nUsers report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.\nSpawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to\neach other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific\ndebate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.\n```\n\nThe debate structure is the key mechanism here. Sequential investigation suffers from anchoring: once one theory is explored, subsequent investigation is biased toward it.\n\nWith multiple independent investigators actively trying to disprove each other, the theory that survives is much more likely to be the actual root cause.\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Give teammates enough context\n\nTeammates load project context automatically, including CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills, but they don't inherit the lead's conversation history. See [Context and communication](#context-and-communication) for details. Include task-specific details in the spawn prompt:\n\n```\nSpawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: \"Review the authentication module\nat src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session\nmanagement, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in\nhttpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings.\"\n```\n\n### Size tasks appropriately\n\n* **Too small**: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit\n* **Too large**: teammates work too long without check-ins, increasing risk of wasted effort\n* **Just right**: self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable, such as a function, a test file, or a review\n\n<Tip>\n  The lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them to teammates automatically. If it isn't creating enough tasks, ask it to split the work into smaller pieces. Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.\n</Tip>\n\n### Wait for teammates to finish\n\nSometimes the lead starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. If you notice this:\n\n```\nWait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding\n```\n\n### Start with research and review\n\nIf you're new to agent teams, start with tasks that have clear boundaries and don't require writing code: reviewing a PR, researching a library, or investigating a bug. These tasks show the value of parallel exploration without the coordination challenges that come with parallel implementation.\n\n### Avoid file conflicts\n\nTwo teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Break the work so each teammate owns a different set of files.\n\n### Monitor and steer\n\nCheck in on teammates' progress, redirect approaches that aren't working, and synthesize findings as they come in. Letting a team run unattended for too long increases the risk of wasted effort.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Teammates not appearing\n\nIf teammates aren't appearing after you ask Claude to create a team:\n\n* In in-process mode, teammates may already be running but not visible. Press Shift+Down to cycle through active teammates.\n* Check that the task you gave Claude was complex enough to warrant a team. Claude decides whether to spawn teammates based on the task.\n* If you explicitly requested split panes, ensure tmux is installed and available in your PATH:\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  which tmux\n  ```\n* For iTerm2, verify the `it2` CLI is installed and the Python API is enabled in iTerm2 preferences.\n\n### Too many permission prompts\n\nTeammate permission requests bubble up to the lead, which can create friction. Pre-approve common operations in your [permission settings](/en/permissions) before spawning teammates to reduce interruptions.\n\n### Teammates stopping on errors\n\nTeammates may stop after encountering errors instead of recovering. Check their output using Shift+Up/Down in in-process mode or by clicking the pane in split mode, then either:\n\n* Give them additional instructions directly\n* Spawn a replacement teammate to continue the work\n\n### Lead shuts down before work is done\n\nThe lead may decide the team is finished before all tasks are actually complete. If this happens, tell it to keep going. You can also tell the lead to wait for teammates to finish before proceeding if it starts doing work instead of delegating.\n\n### Orphaned tmux sessions\n\nIf a tmux session persists after the team ends, it may not have been fully cleaned up. List sessions and kill the one created by the team:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ntmux ls\ntmux kill-session -t <session-name>\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nAgent teams are experimental. Current limitations to be aware of:\n\n* **No session resumption with in-process teammates**: `/resume` and `/rewind` do not restore in-process teammates. After resuming a session, the lead may attempt to message teammates that no longer exist. If this happens, tell the lead to spawn new teammates.\n* **Task status can lag**: teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks as completed, which blocks dependent tasks. If a task appears stuck, check whether the work is actually done and update the task status manually or tell the lead to nudge the teammate.\n* **Shutdown can be slow**: teammates finish their current request or tool call before shutting down, which can take time.\n* **One team per session**: a lead can only manage one team at a time. Clean up the current team before starting a new one.\n* **No nested teams**: teammates cannot spawn their own teams or teammates. Only the lead can manage the team.\n* **Lead is fixed**: the session that creates the team is the lead for its lifetime. You can't promote a teammate to lead or transfer leadership.\n* **Permissions set at spawn**: all teammates start with the lead's permission mode. You can change individual teammate modes after spawning, but you can't set per-teammate modes at spawn time.\n* **Split panes require tmux or iTerm2**: the default in-process mode works in any terminal. Split-pane mode isn't supported in VS Code's integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty.\n\n<Tip>\n  **`CLAUDE.md` works normally**: teammates read `CLAUDE.md` files from their working directory. Use this to provide project-specific guidance to all teammates.\n</Tip>\n\n## Next steps\n\nExplore related approaches for parallel work and delegation:\n\n* **Lightweight delegation**: [subagents](/en/sub-agents) spawn helper agents for research or verification within your session, better for tasks that don't need inter-agent coordination\n* **Manual parallel sessions**: [Git worktrees](/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees) let you run multiple Claude Code sessions yourself without automated team coordination\n* **Compare approaches**: see the [subagent vs agent team](/en/features-overview#compare-similar-features) comparison for a side-by-side breakdown\n"}]},"uuid":"75f69584-70a4-44c3-bc3e-219607cc15c1","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:30:21.482Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4074e714-9faa-41ba-9241-55f0bf5b0dd0"}

Here's how the Agent SDK fits in:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Agent SDK vs Client SDK\">\n    The [Anthropic Client SDK](/docs/en/api/client-sdks) gives you direct API access: you send prompts and implement tool execution yourself. The **Agent SDK** gives you Claude with built-in tool execution.\n\n    With the Client SDK, you implement a tool loop. With the Agent SDK, Claude handles it:\n\n    <CodeGroup>\n    ```python Python\n    # Client SDK: You implement the tool loop\n    response = client.messages.create(...)\n    while response.stop_reason == \"tool_use\":\n        result = your_tool_executor(response.tool_use)\n        response = client.messages.create(tool_result=result, **params)\n\n    # Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomously\n    async for message in query(prompt=\"Fix the bug in auth.py\"):\n        print(message)\n    ```\n\n    ```typescript TypeScript\n    // Client SDK: You implement the tool loop\n    let response = await client.messages.create({ ...params });\n    while (response.stop_reason === \"tool_use\") {\n      const result = yourToolExecutor(response.tool_use);\n      response = await client.messages.create({ tool_result: result, ...params });\n    }\n\n    // Agent SDK: Claude handles tools autonomously\n    for await (const message of query({ prompt: \"Fix the bug in auth.py\" })) {\n      console.log(message);\n    }\n    ```\n    </CodeGroup>\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI\">\n    Same capabilities, different interface:\n\n    | Use case | Best choice |\n    |----------|-------------|\n    | Interactive development | CLI |\n    | CI/CD pipelines | SDK |\n    | Custom applications | SDK |\n    | One-off tasks | CLI |\n    | Production automation | SDK |\n\n    Many teams use both: CLI for daily development, SDK for production.

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a detailed overview of Claude Code's autonomous agent capabilities.\n\n## Comprehensive Overview of Claude Code's Autonomous Agent Capabilities\n\nBased on Anthropic's official documentation, here's what Claude Code can do compared to dedicated frameworks like OpenClaw:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Autonomous Execution Modes\n\nClaude Code offers **multiple ways to run autonomously**:\n\n#### Headless/Programmatic Mode (Fire-and-Forget)\nThe primary autonomous execution method uses the `-p` flag or Agent SDK:\n\n```bash\n# CLI (headless mode)\nclaude -p \"Find and fix bugs in auth.py\" --allowedTools \"Read,Edit,Bash\"\n\n# Structured output for scripts\nclaude -p \"Summarize this project\" --output-format json\n\n# Streaming JSON output\nclaude -p \"Analyze this log\" --output-format stream-json --verbose\n```\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Non-interactive execution that runs to completion\n- Supports structured output (JSON with schema validation)\n- Can return results as plain text, JSON, or streaming JSON\n- Full control over allowed tools and permissions\n- Can be integrated into CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, or scheduled jobs\n\n#### Agent SDK (Python/TypeScript)\nFor production applications with programmatic control:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions\n\nasync def main():\n    async for message in query(\n        prompt=\"Fix the bug in auth.py\",\n        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=[\"Read\", \"Edit\", \"Bash\"])\n    ):\n        print(message)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n**Advantages over CLI headless mode:**\n- Structured message objects with full context\n- Custom tool callbacks for approval workflows\n- Session management and resumption\n- Hooks for intercepting and controlling behavior\n- Native language integration (no shell parsing needed)\n\n#### Desktop App with Background Sessions\nClaude Code's desktop application lets you:\n- Run multiple sessions in parallel with isolated worktrees\n- Keep tasks running in the background while you work\n- Resume or fork sessions later\n- Visual diff review for all changes\n\n---\n\n### 2. \"Fire and Forget\" Autonomous Execution\n\nClaude Code supports true autonomous execution patterns:\n\n**Basic one-shot execution:**\n```bash\nclaude -p \"Run tests and fix failures\" --allowedTools \"Bash,Read,Edit\"\n```\n\n**Scheduled execution (via cron):**\n```bash\n0 9 * * * claude -p \"Generate daily report\" --output-format json | jq '.result' > report.txt\n```\n\n**CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions):**\n```yaml\nname: Claude Code Review\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened]\njobs:\n  review:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          prompt: \"/review\"\n          claude_args: \"--max-turns 5\"\n```\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- No user interaction required\n- Automatic approval of specified tools\n- Respects your project's CLAUDE.md standards\n- Can create PRs, commits, and push changes\n- Optional structured output for downstream processing\n\n---\n\n### 3. Scheduling & Triggering Options\n\nClaude Code integrates with multiple triggering mechanisms:\n\n#### GitHub Actions (Built-in)\n- Responds to `@claude` mentions in PRs/issues\n- Scheduled workflows (cron syntax)\n- Event-driven automation (on PR open, issue assigned, etc.)\n- Supports AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI for data residency\n\n#### GitLab CI/CD\n- Turn issues into MRs automatically\n- Get implementation help on demand\n- Fix bugs quickly with autonomous execution\n\n#### Custom Scheduling\n- Cron jobs (standard Linux)\n- External orchestration tools\n- Webhook triggers\n- Pre-commit hooks\n\n#### Example: Autonomous daily cleanup\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Daily linting at 9 AM\nclaude -p \"Run eslint on changed files and auto-fix\" \\\n  --allowedTools \"Bash(npm run lint:fix),Bash(git diff),Bash(git commit)\" \\\n  --output-format json | jq -r '.result' | mail -s \"Daily Lint Report\" team@company.com\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Permission & Safety Systems\n\nClaude Code has a **granular permission framework** designed for autonomous execution:\n\n#### Permission Modes\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Bash(npm test:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git commit:*)\",\n      \"Edit\",\n      \"Read\"\n    ],\n    \"deny\": [\"Bash(rm -rf)\"],\n    \"ask\": [\"Bash(git push)\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Five permission strategies:**\n\n1. **Interactive** (default): Claude asks for permission on every action\n2. **Accept edits**: Auto-approve file changes but ask about Bash\n3. **Accept all**: Skip all permission prompts (with warnings)\n4. **Bypass permissions** (SDK only): Full autonomy for contained workflows\n5. **Fine-grained rules**: Specify exactly which commands are allowed\n\n#### Sandboxing (OS-Level Protection)\nOptional filesystem and network isolation:\n```bash\nclaude /sandbox  # Enable sandboxing\n```\n\n**What sandboxing provides:**\n- Filesystem isolation (restricted to project directory)\n- Network policy enforcement (whitelist approved domains)\n- Prevents prompt injection attacks\n- Transparent operation (no code visibility needed)\n- Works alongside permission system for defense-in-depth\n\n#### Safety Features\n- **Automatic checkpoints**: Every action creates a restore point\n- **Pre-execution review**: Rewind and examine changes before approving\n- **Tool restrictions**: Limit which commands can run\n- **Git integration**: All changes tracked, easy to revert\n- **Audit trails**: Hooks can log all autonomous actions\n\n---\n\n### 5. Context & Memory for Long-Running Agents\n\nClaude Code has sophisticated context management:\n\n#### Sessions (Persistent Across Calls)\n```bash\n# Start with session ID capture\nsession_id=$(claude -p \"Read the auth module\" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id')\n\n# Resume with full context from previous query\nclaude -p \"Now find all places that call it\" --resume \"$session_id\"\n```\n\n**Session capabilities:**\n- Maintain conversation history across multiple calls\n- Preserve file state and analysis from previous steps\n- Full context window available (up to 200k tokens with extended context)\n- Resume after interruption or system restart\n\n#### File Checkpointing\n- Automatic restore points before every edit\n- Rewind to any previous checkpoint\n- Restore just code or code + conversation history\n- Summarize from a checkpoint to save context space\n\n#### Auto-Compaction\nWhen context window fills, Claude automatically:\n- Summarizes irrelevant conversation\n- Preserves critical code state\n- Maintains key architectural decisions\n- Frees space for new work\n\n**Customizable compaction in CLAUDE.md:**\n```markdown\nWhen compacting, always preserve:\n- The full list of modified files\n- Test commands and their results\n- Key architectural decisions\n```\n\n#### Skills & CLAUDE.md (Persistent Instructions)\n```markdown\n# CLAUDE.md - loaded every session\n- Use ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS\n- Always run tests after code changes\n- Use git worktrees for parallel work\n\n# .claude/skills/api-conventions/SKILL.md\nSkills are loaded on-demand, keeping base context lean.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Multi-Agent Coordination (Agent Teams)\n\nClaude Code supports autonomous multi-agent orchestration:\n\n#### Architecture\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         Team Lead (orchestrator)        │\n│  - Breaks work into tasks              │\n│  - Assigns to teammates                │\n│  - Synthesizes results                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n           ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓\n    ┌──────┬──┬──┬──┴────────────┐\n    ↓      ↓  ↓  ↓               ↓\n  Teammate 1  2  3  4  5...  (independent sessions)\n  - Each has own context window\n  - Communicate directly with each other\n  - Work from shared task list\n  - No speed-of-light dependency on lead\n```\n\n**When teams help:**\n- Parallel code review (security, performance, tests reviewers work simultaneously)\n- Competing hypotheses debugging (multiple theories tested in parallel)\n- Multi-layer changes (frontend, backend, tests owned by different agents)\n- Large-scale migrations (many files refactored in parallel)\n\n**Example: Autonomous parallel code review**\n```bash\nclaude\n# Then request:\nCreate an agent team to review PR #142 with three reviewers:\n- One focused on security implications\n- One checking performance impact  \n- One validating test coverage\nHave them review and report findings.\n```\n\nEach reviewer works independently in its own context, then they synthesize findings. Far more thorough than a single reviewer.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Limitations vs Dedicated Frameworks\n\n**Claude Code strengths:**\n- Built-in tool execution (no external tool wrapper needed)\n- Context management with auto-compaction\n- Deep git integration\n- Multi-agent coordination with shared task lists\n- Session persistence and resumption\n- GitHub/GitLab CI/CD integration ready\n- Sandboxing for safety\n- Permission system designed for autonomy\n\n**Limitations vs frameworks like OpenClaw:**\n- **No persistent long-term memory** between unrelated sessions (intentional: each session is fresh unless explicitly resumed)\n- **Model coupling**: Built on Claude only (can't use other models natively)\n- **Git-centric**: Best suited for code/development workflows\n- **Tool set** is curated (focused on developer productivity, not general purpose)\n- **Agent teams are experimental** (beta features, known limitations around resumption)\n- **No built-in RAG/vector search** (can use external tools via MCP)\n- **Claude Pro/Max constraint**: Full autonomous mode with sandboxing requires API access\n\n**Key trade-offs:**\n- OpenClaw is a general agent framework; Claude Code is optimized for coding\n- Claude Code's tool set is smaller but deeply integrated; general frameworks require tool implementation\n- Claude Code has better context management; general frameworks leave this to you\n- Claude Code is deeply integrated with Git; general frameworks are code-agnostic\n\n---\n\n### 8. Claude Pro/Max vs API Subscription\n\n**What you get with each:**\n\n| Feature | Claude Pro | Claude Max | API |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----|\n| **Models** | Sonnet (latest) | Opus 4.5 (latest frontier) | All available (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) |\n| **Claude Code CLI** | Yes | Yes | No (use Agent SDK instead) |\n| **Interactive web sessions** | Yes | Yes | N/A |\n| **Desktop app** | Yes | Yes | No |\n| **Headless/SDK execution** | No | No | **Yes** |\n| **Rate limits** | High | Higher | Custom per plan |\n| **Context window** | 200k (standard) | 200k (standard) | Up to 200k |\n| **Cost per million tokens** | $3–15 | $15–60 | $3–60 (pay-as-you-go) |\n| **Best for** | Interactive development | Interactive, high-frequency use | **Autonomous agents, production** |\n\n**For autonomous agents specifically:**\n- **Claude Pro/Max**: Great for interactive development + occasional headless via CLI, but no programmatic SDK\n- **API subscription**: Required for production autonomous agents (Agent SDK in Python/TypeScript)\n- **Bedrock/Vertex AI**: Enterprise option for data residency\n\n---\n\n### 9. Practical Autonomous Patterns\n\n#### Pattern 1: CI/CD Quality Gates\n```yaml\nname: Auto-Fix Linting\non:\n  pull_request:\njobs:\n  fix:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          prompt: \"Run eslint and fix all fixable issues\"\n          claude_args: \"--max-turns 3\"\n```\n\n#### Pattern 2: Scheduled Reporting\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Daily security scan - cron: 0 9 * * *\nclaude -p \"Run security audit and report issues\" \\\n  --allowedTools \"Bash,Read\" \\\n  --output-format json | jq '.result' > report.json\n```\n\n#### Pattern 3: Multi-File Fan-Out\n```bash\nfor file in $(find src -name \"*.ts\" -newer .last_review); do\n  claude -p \"Migrate $file to new API\" \\\n    --allowedTools \"Edit,Read,Bash(git diff)\" \\\n    --max-turns 5\ndone\n```\n\n#### Pattern 4: Event-Driven with Webhooks\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions\nimport asyncio\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/webhook/issue-created\")\nasync def on_issue(issue):\n    async for message in query(\n        prompt=f\"Fix the issue: {issue['body']}\",\n        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=[\"Read\", \"Edit\", \"Bash\"])\n    ):\n        pass\n    # Create PR automatically\n    return {\"status\": \"complete\"}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. Evaluation: Can Claude Code Replace OpenClaw?\n\n**For development workflows: YES**\n- Better integrated with Git/GitHub\n- Superior context management\n- Native tool execution\n- Multi-agent coordination built-in\n- Safer permission system\n\n**For general automation: MAYBE**\n- OpenClaw more general-purpose\n- Claude Code is development-focused\n- Can extend Claude Code with MCP servers for custom tools\n- If your domain is coding, Claude Code wins; if it's general ops, frameworks are safer\n\n**For your specific needs:**\nGiven you're evaluating OpenClaw for autonomous agent work:\n1. **If it's code-related**: Claude Code (API) with Agent SDK is superior\n2. **If it's mixed**: Use Claude Code for code, MCP servers for external tools\n3. **If it's general ops**: Consider hybrid approach or dedicated framework\n\n---\n\n### Quick-Start for Autonomous Execution\n\n```bash\n# 1.
